## Why did you stop practicing alchemy? Roll 1d6:

||                 ||
| ---- | ---- |----|
|1|**Aimlessness**| You never excelled in any particular field, instead dabbling in many subjects without focus. You can only create parlor tricks, useful for dazzle and not much else. Take a card game you created. You know how to win every time.|
|2|**Heresy**| Local clergy found your theories and practices to be blasphemous and confiscated your works. You escaped with a **Relic** (cast _Raise Dead_ once per day). They still look for you, and using the **Relic** may alert them to your location.|
|3|**Exiled**| You accidentally brewed a love potion for a client, an heir to a local position of nobility. They were infatuated with you, but their parents had other ideas. With the proper ingredients, you know how to make the _Shroud_ potion (take one now).|
|4|**Overstepped**| You are followed by a homunculus, a small 6-inch replica of yourself. You created it, and it hates being enthralled to you. Though it will follow your commands to the letter, it will try to undo your requests whenever possible. Any damage done to the homunculus is also done to you.|
|5|**Betrayed**| You discovered evidence that someone - you don't know who - was slowly experimenting on you. Occasionally you experience terrifying visions of the future. You rarely feel hunger and need only eat every 3 days. Take antitoxin.  |
|6|**Accident**| The last concoction you brewed resulted in a massive explosion, scarring you horribly. Most folk will look away from whatever you're up to. You can walk handle fire for small spurts without taking injury. Take fire oil.|

## What alchemical keepsake did you take with you? Roll 1d6:

||                 ||
| ---- | ---- |----|
|1|**Alchemist's Fire**|A clay bottle filled with sticky green fluid that catches fire when exposed to air. Counts a bottle of burning oil without needing to lit.|
|2|**Bomb**|Head-sized iron ball filled with explosive powder with an attached wick. Deals 1d12 [blast](https://cairnrpg.com/cairn-srd/#blast) damage.|
|3|**Vial of Acid**|Can disintegrate 1 cubic inch of any surface.|
|4|**Tincture Of Truth-Talking**|Only a few drops remain, enough for one dose. This tasteless clear liquid will compel whoever ingests it to answer questions truthfully for d6 \* 10 minutes.|
|5|**Magnesium Shavings**|A pouch containing d6 uses that will easily ignite and burn intensely.|
|6|**Basic Alchemist's Kit**|A wooden chest filled with four corked glass vials and stand, a small bronze weight scale, pestle & mortar, stirring rods, a bottle of solvent, and a pouch of salt. Bulky.|

## Debt
- As a group, you share a debt of 1000 gold pieces. If you die, your next character inherits whatever share of the debt you still owe. Debtholders will pursue payment and terms.
- Your debhtholder is the **Wooden Dead**, a faction of benign Forest Liches. Your party trespassed one of their invisible boundaries and can only be repaired through the planting of a new grove of rare trees. Until your debt is paid, trees and plants wilt at your touch.
