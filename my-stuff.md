Here is some free stuff that I've made over the years. I'm a big fan of [CC BY-SA 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/).

## PbtA

#### [One Shot World](https://yochaigal.itch.io/oneshotworld)
One Shot World is a hack of Dungeon World that removes most of the long-form mechanics and replaces them with simple rules designed to facilitate one-shots and short campaigns. There are also some useful tools in the GM Booklet (session starters, worldbuilding tips, etc) that would work for other systems, as well.

#### [Dungeon World Syllabus](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ORjM3sxhQrwNI_chlNzYFMD5OFHj7u-Rs_gY4kHkzO0)
When I first discovered Dungeon World, I was overwhelmed by the incredible amount of 3rd-party resources, playbooks, hacks, etc that folks had built for the system. So I decided to chronicle my findings. Over the years, this document has become the go-to point of reference for many new GMs & players alike.

#### [Keys for Dungeon World](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1TMtedwe7X_CZ6K07rdJfGR904RgamtFJYOXLUaia87E/edit)
Keys are goals, ties, beliefs, or vows a character has. They are meant to replace Alignment or Drives completely. Shamelessly stolen from better designers.
<br>

#### [The Sorcerer Playbook](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0BzeF5GXNEsnfdDhkZV9tZDNwQVk) ([Dungeon World](https://dungeon-world.com/))
An alternative spellcasting playbook to the Wizard, that doesn't require spell memorization, and uses CHA as a prime stat. I'm pretty proud of the move titles.
<br>

## OSR

#### [Into The Odd Syllabus](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ipMsbNE5EH6-1_d58o_JfneF2XA4yWqfr5XxJInSzqI/edit)
When I started running Into The Odd, I again found a system with a veritable bouquet of excellent tools, hacks, tips & resources, but no single place to keep all of the relevant links! And thus the Into The Odd Syllabus was born.  
<br>

#### [The Arcanist](https://docs.google.com/document/d/14Bz9I5HEY8l34YQn_DA0NdqePcJqtL2HuPPA0aVp9WY/edit?usp=sharing) ([Into The Dungeon: Revived](https://github.com/Vladar4/itdr))
An overpowered alternative magic user.

#### [Generations](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1DAGO4M8aryGzXVdCHYomsnTkJrF9YJBp/view?usp=sharing) | [Pocketmod](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1TY9jatNzgzH8DYH1rgeSRPzLjAueRo6w)
A game about a generation ship, and the factions (and subsequent generations) living within.
<br>

## Misc

#### [Collaborative Worldbuilding](https://docs.google.com/document/d/160M8iXPRF8sGIFhtZGhCX-p4AnfLFMAgIk7Qnw568VI/edit) (WIP)
A guide on collaborative worldbuilding and character generation.
