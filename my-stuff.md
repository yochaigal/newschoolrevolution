Here is some free stuff that I've made over the years. I'm a big fan of [CC BY-SA 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/).
<br>

## OSR
#### [Cairn](https://yochaigal.github.io/cairn/)
A mash-up of Knave and Into the Odd-style games for play in fantastical forests. Designed in such a way to plug-and-play B/X materials (as much as I liked, anyway) while relying on a simpler mechanical system without difficulty in conversion.

#### [The Clay Shelf](https://yochaigal.itch.io/the-clay-shelf)
An adventure for [Into The Odd: Electric Bastionland](https://chrismcdee.itch.io/electric-bastionland), set in the **Deep Country**, far from the civilized domains of **Bastion**.

#### [The Positronic Library](https://yochaigal.itch.io/the-positronic-library)
A simple adventure site for [Into The Odd: Electric Bastionland](https://chrismcdee.itch.io/electric-bastionland), or similar rules-lite OSR games.

#### [Into The Odd Syllabus](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ipMsbNE5EH6-1_d58o_JfneF2XA4yWqfr5XxJInSzqI/edit)
When I started running Into The Odd, I again found a system with a veritable bouquet of excellent tools, hacks, tips & resources, but no single place to keep all of the relevant links! And thus the Syllabus was born.  

#### [Into The Odd Content](https://yochaigal.github.io/intotheodd/)
A massive list of oddities, careers, monsters and hacks for Into The Odd.

#### [The Arcanist](https://docs.google.com/document/d/14Bz9I5HEY8l34YQn_DA0NdqePcJqtL2HuPPA0aVp9WY/edit?usp=sharing) ([Into The Dungeon: Revived](https://github.com/Vladar4/itdr))
An overpowered alternative magic user.

## PbtA
#### [One Shot World](https://yochaigal.itch.io/oneshotworld)
One Shot World is a hack of Dungeon World that removes most of the long-form mechanics and replaces them with simple rules designed to facilitate one-shots and short campaigns. There are also some useful tools in the GM Booklet (session starters, worldbuilding tips, etc) that would work for other systems, as well.  

#### [Dungeon World Syllabus](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ORjM3sxhQrwNI_chlNzYFMD5OFHj7u-Rs_gY4kHkzO0)
When I first discovered Dungeon World, I was overwhelmed by the incredible amount of 3rd-party resources, playbooks, hacks, etc that folks had built for the system. So I decided to chronicle my findings. Over the years, this document has become the go-to point of reference for many new GMs & players alike.  

#### [Keys for Dungeon World](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1TMtedwe7X_CZ6K07rdJfGR904RgamtFJYOXLUaia87E/edit)
Keys are goals, ties, beliefs, or vows a character has. They are meant to replace Alignment or Drives completely. Shamelessly stolen from better designers.

#### [Alternative Location Rules For Dungeon World](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1rycFBuJc5N52Za6mTr-ehayrk5l2FK6EZKJn9Kpv2WE)
A fairly concrete method for treating locations as _monsters_.

#### [The Sorcerer Playbook for Dungeon World](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0BzeF5GXNEsnfdDhkZV9tZDNwQVk)
An alternative spellcasting playbook to the Wizard, that doesn't require spell memorization, and uses CHA as a prime stat. I'm pretty proud of the move titles.

## Minimald6

#### [Generations](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1DAGO4M8aryGzXVdCHYomsnTkJrF9YJBp/view?usp=sharing) | [Pocketmod](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1TY9jatNzgzH8DYH1rgeSRPzLjAueRo6w)
A game about a generation ship, and the factions (and subsequent generations) living within.

## Misc

#### [Collaborative Worldbuilding](https://newschoolrevolution.com/2020/02/19/build-your-world)
A guide on collaborative worldbuilding and character generation.
