In this post, I'm going to describe exactly how I create an original, collaborative setting in under 45 minutes. If you're not very interested in the _why_, [skip ahead](#tools-of-the-trade) to get started!

### Why Build a World Together?

A lot of folks start their GMing career by running modules or published adventures for more traditional systems (like D&D 3.5/5e), where the setting was consistent and self-contained, and their authority was total. The suggestion that we might somehow share the imaginary load with our players might therefore seem downright crazy. But fear not! As the GM, you will still be the final judge on what gets into the game setting, and what doesn't. And more importantly, you get to let the players _do your job for you_; your mental bandwidth is thus freed up a bit. It will improve your improvisational skills, and might even find yourself _amazed_ at what your players come up with.

### Why an Original Setting?

Over the past decade or so, there has been an absolute explosion of adventure modules and dungeon starters coming out of the indie RPG scene, as well as for old school and traditional systems. Most are free to download (or available for a very low-cost). Why not take advantage of the richness of others' imaginations, and play in a consistent, ordered world? If this works for you: wonderful! Carry on. But if you're anything like me, you take pure joy in trying to create something truly unique: a setting or world unlike anything you (or your players) have experienced before.

Furthermore, why limit ourselves to the imaginations of others? We should definitely take inspiration from what's out there, sure - but let's not limit ourselves to the worlds that others have built! If you (and your players) can create something truly your own, player investment and engagement will be higher. Plus, no more flipping around a setting book, searching for the backstory for that pesky NPC you didn't prep for.

Personally, I find tropes and assumptions (particularly in fantasy gaming) act more as a sort of mental roadblock; limiting not only your imagination, but what is possible within the fiction as well. As a GM, I never _name_ monsters when describing them, unless the players (or the player characters) are already familiar with them. For instance, if the PCs have encountered a group of short green-skinned creatures wielding missile weapons and displaying sharpened teeth, I do not tell the players, "Your party comes across a pack of Goblins." If I _name_ the creature, the players (and the GM) automatically assume what may or may not be possible within the fiction; it is very unlikely that the creatures will suddenly sport wings and fly way, for instance. But if the description presented to the players is vague (within reason) as well as useful (perhaps hinting towards something that is about to happen), who knows what may occur? Are the players as likely to concoct a risky scheme if they believe the enemy is fulfilling the trope of a weak, cowardly creature? And if they _do_ take that risk, is it not far more satisfying to reveal their hubris by upending those tropes?

### Tools of the Trade

* A blank sheet of paper. If measurements matter to you, get hex or grid paper.
* Pencils & Erasers (no pens, please)
* Index cards (for PC names). I sometimes use standard or hex index cards! See [below](#the-hex-or-index-card-method).
* You can also use a wet-erase board or mat; just don't forget to take a picture before cleaning!

One of my players drew this on a wet erase board during a single session:

### The Veil of Ignorance
Before character creation, I like to begin by asking each player to help me shape the setting by naming a single **Truth** (no more than one or two sentences) about the world we are about to play in. Although this might feel a bit risky, I strongly encourage you try it out! Besides, the GM is the final arbiter in this, as in all things.

#### Rules:
  * Each **Truth** should be specific (e.g. _the world is mostly water_) as well as defining of the setting (_sentient sea creatures rule civilization_).    
 * Each **Truth** cannot conflict with a truth another player has already stated, but players may build on top of what has been said before.
 * The GM can help shape the answers by asking follow-up questions.
 * Go around more than once if it feels necessary! The GM can also participate.  

#### Examples:
 * _The landscape is littered with ancient, barely understood technology. Those who have learned to control it are the true rulers of the world._
 * _The starting locale is shrouded in darkness most of the time. The Sun is blamed for most of the nation's woes._
 * _Kingdoms are insular and divided by stark cultural and linguistic differences (name a few)._
 * _There are no non-humanoid peoples, though myths of mutated humanoids abound._
 * _A council of Mages rules the known world; they hold onto power by creating powerful technology only they control._    

A final note: it is _extremely important_ that character creation come _after_ the **Truth**-telling. If the players aren't sure of their character's status in society, it'll make for a more interesting session!

### Question Time
* _Is there Magic in this world?_ _What does it look like?_ _How common is it?_
* _What about Gods? If they exist, do they walk the lands, and do people know about them?_
* _What about technology?_
* _How is news passed around?_
* _Were there any recent wars or political upheavals?_

These should be tailored to the answers the GM received earlier; but in general follow the narratives that players seem most excited about.

### A Map of The World

What can be said for worldbuilding also describes collaborative map creation: try to play on available tropes, but leave space for subverting and enhancing any ideas generated during play. As they say in [Dungeon World](https://dungeon-world.com) **Draw Maps, Leave Blanks**. I find that a partially-drawn map helps open up possibilities I might not have considered before. Say the Imperial Highway (which heads East from the Crescent City) splinters into smaller roads after it splits the Great Pass; where does each lead to? What about the one leading to that unusual tower, standing alone in the Whispering Grasses? Who is the most well-traveled among the party? Perhaps they know something unusual about that area? What rumors have they heard?
