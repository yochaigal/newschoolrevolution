# Cairn Plans For 2022

## First: 2021 in Review
We've built quite an amazing community around Cairn (especially thanks to the NSR Discord). I am deeply humbled by this, you guys ROCK. We have [adventures](https://cairnrpg.com/resources/adventures), [hacks](https://cairnrpg.com/hacks/third-party/) and [translations](https://cairnrpg.com/localizations).


## Cairn
### Cairn Jam
- Seeing the incredible success of the [DURF Jam](https://itch.io/jam/durfjam) and others, I'd love to do one as well!
- I think I'd push for a tight focus, with an emphasis on adventures and settings!
- Maybe "Forests of another kind" or something.

### Module: The Dawn Plague (working title)
An overland adventure and dungeon. Thematically built around themes like:
- Kabbalah
- Jewish Folklore
- The pre-Shoah Eastern Europe
- Belonging
- Prejudice & Xenophobia
- Survivor Syndrome

In terms of design, it should focus on folk critical thinking and problem solving. The adventure is already written; it's mostly a bunch of locations, a central mystery, and a dungeon (modeled after the Sefirot if you're familiar!). I've been very lucky to find two incredibly talented designers (both Jewish, a coincidence I swear!) to make the setting feel _real_. I can't wait to show off the end result!

### "Little Black Books"
- A set of books for ease of use at the table.
- Easy to pass around; cheap options to get multiple copies of the player's guide.
- The **Adventure's Guide** would be for at-the-table character creation and rules reference
- The **Warden's Manual** is more for general advice but would have tools for ease-of-use at the table as well. I have considered splitting it up into a third "tables" book that's more table-friendly.

#### An Adventurer's Guide
- Game Rules
- Expanded Player Principles & Advice.
- Character creation: "Backgrounds" done in the style of _Failed Careers_ from Electric Bastionland.
- Character creation: Massively expanded random tables (double each?).
- Try to make it cheap so 3-4 players can make their PCs at the same time.

#### The Warden's Manual
- General Advice for running the game
- Rewritten rules based around the FAQ
- Example of play
- Optional Rules for expanded domains, common rulings, etc
- How to make a pointcrawl
- How to make a dungeon
- Worldbuilding advice
- Setting generation tables
- Advice on conversion from OSR modules
- A Bestiary
- A Reliquary
- MOAR SPELLS FOR THE SPELL GOD

#### Example adventure
- A basic starting adventure/hexcrawl/dungeon for new players
- An original Setting
- A "teaching" dungeon with commentary

### Third party
- Zines
- Translations
- Hacks

### Community
- Jim Parkin: Convert complete Wormskin bestiary, adventure area about wood god avatars, covertly guarding a Bad Thing™️ from escaping.
- Matthew Morris: Supplement where the PCs are 18th century sailors and engage in oversea "hexploration"; also a couple more issues of Caers & Crannogs
- Adam Hensley: Working on a science fantasy hack
- David Lombardo: Finish [Meteor Corp](https://discourse.rpgcauldron.com/t/meteor-corp-corporate-sci-fi-cairn-hack-ashcan/519); "Cairn at the Ren Faire" adventure
