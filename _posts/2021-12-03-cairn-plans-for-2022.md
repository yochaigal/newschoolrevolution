# Cairn Plans For 2022

## First: 2021 in Review
We've built quite an amazing community around Cairn (especially thanks to the NSR Discord). I am deeply humbled by this, you guys ROCK. We have [adventures](), [hacks](https://cairnrpg.com/hacks/third-party/) and translations


## Cairn
### Cairn Jam
- Seeing the incredible success of the [DURF Jam](https://itch.io/jam/durfjam) and others, I'd love to do one as well, with an emphasis on adventures and settings!

### Module: The Dawn Plague (working title)
An overland adventure and dungeon. Thematically built around themes like:
- Kabbalah
- Jewish Folk tales
- The pre-Shoah Eastern Europe
- Belonging
- Prejudice & Xenophobia
- Survivor Syndrome


It will also have critical thinking and problem solving and all that.

I've got an overland/travel map, a bunch of locations, and a dungeon modeled after the Sefirot (if you're familiar). I actually think it's gonna be AWESOME.
I have found two artists I want to work with (both Jews... I don't know how that happened) and they both have given terms.

### "Little Black Books"
- A set of books for ease of use at the table.
- Easy to pass around; cheap options to get multiple copies of the player's guide.
- I actually haven't decided if these should be two books or three! I could combine the Warden's Manual with the Explorer's Guide, but not everyone will need the content there...

#### An Adventurer's Guide
- Game Rules
- Expanded Player Principles & Advice.
- Character creation: "Backgrounds" done in the style of _Failed Careers_ from Electric Bastionland.
- Character creation: Massively expanded random tables (double each?)
- Try to make it cheap so 3-4 players can make their PCs at the same time.

#### The Warden's Manual
- General Advice for running the game
- Example session
- Advice on conversion from OSR modules
- Optional Rules for expanded domains, common rulings, etc
- How to make a pointcrawl
- How to make a dungeon

#### Explorer's Compendium
- General worldbuilding advice
- Setting generation tables
- Example adventure
- Bestiary
- Relics & Spells

### Third party
- Zines
- Translations
- Hacks

### Community
- Jim Parkin: Convert complete Wormskin bestiary, adventure area about wood god avatars, covertly guarding a Bad Thing™️ from escaping.
- Matthew Morris: Supplement where the PCs are 18th century sailors and engage in oversea "hexploration"; also a couple more issues of Caers & Crannogs
- Adam Hensley: Working on a science fantasy hack
- David Lombardo: Finish [Meteor Corp](https://discourse.rpgcauldron.com/t/meteor-corp-corporate-sci-fi-cairn-hack-ashcan/519); "Cairn at the Ren Faire" adventure
