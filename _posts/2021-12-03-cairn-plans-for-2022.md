# Cairn Plans For 2022

We've built quite an amazing community around Cairn (especially thanks to the NSR Discord). I am deeply humbled by this, you guys ROCK. We have [adventures](https://cairnrpg.com/resources/adventures), [hacks](https://cairnrpg.com/hacks/third-party/) and [translations](https://cairnrpg.com/localizations). We now have a [ton](https://cairnrpg.com/resources/adventure-conversions/) conversions of many great OSR products; checkout what's coming in the [future](https://cairnrpg.com/resources/adventure-conversions/future-conversions/)!  

## Cairn
### Cairn Jam
- Seeing the incredible success of the [DURF Jam](https://itch.io/jam/durfjam) and others, I'd love to do one as well!
- I think I'd push for a tight focus, with an emphasis on adventures and settings!
- Maybe "forests of another kind" or something.
- I'm all for ideas here, people.

### Module: The Dawn Plague (working title)
This is probably the first major Cairn-related thing I'm working on next year. In essence, it's an overland adventure and dungeon that I've been writing and playtesting for over a year!  
Thematically, the module will include themes like:  
- Kabbalah
- Jewish Folklore
- The pre-Shoah Eastern Europe
- Belonging
- Prejudice & Xenophobia
- Survivor Syndrome

In terms of design, I'm focusing critical thinking, problem solving and player agency. The adventure is already written; it's mostly a bunch of locations, a central mystery, and a dungeon. The latter is modeled after the Sefirot (if you're familiar!) and I'm quite proud of it. I've also been very lucky to find some incredibly talented people (read: they draw good, real good) to help make the setting feel real and (hopefully) quite horrifying. I can't wait to show off the end result!

### Little Black Books
- A set of books for ease of use at the table.
- Easy to pass around; cheap options to get multiple copies of the player's guide.
- The **Adventure's Guide** would be for at-the-table character creation and rules reference
- The **Warden's Manual** is more for general advice but would have tools for ease-of-use at the table as well.

#### The Adventurer's Guide
- Game Rules!
- Expanded Player Principles & Advice.
- Character creation: "Backgrounds" done in the style of _Failed Careers_ from _Electric Bastionland_.
- Character creation: Massively expanded random tables (double each?).
- More optional gear packages (also called [fantasy loadouts](https://cairnrpg.com/more-content/fantasy-loadouts/))!
- Advancement options & ideas. We're talking "[Foreground Growth](https://www.bastionland.com/2016/05/foreground-growth-and-becoming-odd.html)" if you're familiar.
- Try to make it cheap so 3-4 players can make their PCs at the same time.

#### The Warden's Manual
- General Advice for running the game.
- Rewritten rules based around the [FAQ](https://cairnrpg.com/resources/frequently-asked-questions/) on the website.
- An [example of play](https://cairnrpg.com/resources/example-of-play/).
- Optional rules for expanded domains, common rulings, alternative procedures, etc
- How to make a pointcrawl!
- How to make a dungeon.
- Worldbuilding advice (including collaborative options).
- Setting generation tables.
- Advice on monster/trap/puzzle conversions from other systems.
- A [Bestiary](https://cairnrpg.com/resources/monsters/)
- A Reliquary
- MOAR SPELLS FOR THE SPELL GOD

#### Example adventure
- A basic starting adventure/hexcrawl/dungeon for new and experienced players.
- Based on an original setting (hopefully something I can build on).
- Should include a "teaching" dungeon with designer commentary.

### Community
- Jim Parkin: Convert the complete Wormskin bestiary, write adventure area about wood god avatars (covertly guarding a Bad Thing™️ from escaping).
- Matthew Morris: Supplement where the PCs are 18th century sailors and engage in oversea "hexploration"; also a couple more issues of Caers & Crannogs
- Adam Hensley: Working on a science fantasy hack.
- David Lombardo: Finish [Meteor Corp](https://discourse.rpgcauldron.com/t/meteor-corp-corporate-sci-fi-cairn-hack-ashcan/519); also an adventure called "Cairn at the Ren Faire" which is apparently 80% finished.
