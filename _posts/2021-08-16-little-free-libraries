  # Little Free Libraries

Over the past month I have been "seeding" [Little Free Libraries](https://littlefreelibrary.org) all over town with RPGs, character sheets, dice and adventures. I've mostly been giving out [Cairn](https://cairnrpg.com) and [Rogueland](https://www.cavernsofheresy.com/product/rogueland). I'm prepping Maze Rats and Knave as well, likely to bundled with one page adventures.
