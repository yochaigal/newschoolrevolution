# A Simple Game
My son is 5 this April. Like most kids he _loves_ games, particularly any that involve fantasy violence.

## What is a game?

## What makes a game _good_?

## Two Simple Games

### [Game Name]
#### Basic Rules
My son and I have been writing a game together. It's simple, uses minis, wooden blocks (or Jenga pieces), and can be played with or without a GM.

### [Counterspell]
There are no props or dice needed to play **Counterspell**, though you can choose to write down your results as you play. We like to shout our spells at each other.

#### Basic Rules
- The goal is to create a unique spell name that (within the session) cannot be dispelled.
- Each round has an Attacker and a Defender. Repeat until the Defender cannot successfully dispel or defend against the Attacker’s spell.

The Attacker must create a spell with the following conditions:
- Is two distinct words (compound is OK)
- Is comprised of a noun + verb or verb + noun
- Is unique to this session
- Is offensive (e.g. would harm the Defender)

The **Defender** must create a spell with the following conditions:
- Is made up of two distinct words (compound is OK)
- Is comprised of a noun + adjective or adjective + noun
- Is unique to this session
- Is defensive (e.g. would dispel or defend against the Attacker's spell

Advanced rules:
- Alliterations only
- Single word spell names
- Vancian magic only
- Extra points for defensive spells becoming attack spells in next round
- Can’t use X word
- Rhyming spells
