On December 21nd, [Shane Ivey](https://mobile.twitter.com/Pandatheist) published a short, simple entry on his blog [**Bone Box Chant**](https://boneboxchant.wordpress.com) called ["New School Revolution"](https://boneboxchant.wordpress.com/2019/12/21/nsr/). What I found so inspiring was how accurately he'd been able to describe the exact play style I preferred, without the classic snobbishness you might expect from such a thought-provoking piece.
I've reproduced the original description here:

### NSR games have:
* A GM
* A Weird Setting
* A Living World
<p></p>
### are:
* Rules lite
* Deadly
<p></p>
### and focus on:
* Emergent Narrative
* External Interaction
* Exploration
<p></p>

And that's basically it! Inclusive. No purity tests, no rules requirements, no us vs them, just a brief list of stuff to help find games that match your taste. Think of this(with maybe the exception of the GM requirement) as a series of Venn Diagrams. The more you hit the more people will agree with your categorization.

So what’s the point of this? Games like Mothership, World of Dungeons, Troika, and Into the Odd have almost nothing in common if you just look at the mechanics. But drop someone who enjoys any one of those into a game of the other and they’ll probably have a good time. The games all share a perspective. The term NSR is useful in that it describes a style of play. “If I like game X I will probably like game Y.” or “I don’t love game X as written but I can run it in an NSR style.”

I have no interest in introducing yet another term for internecine warfare. But I see a descriptive gap for this style of play. OSR is heavily tied to old school D&D. Artpunk hasn’t really caught on. Sword Dream is mostly an itch.io phenomena. It feels like we need something else. Please use the term NSR if you find it useful. I certainly do.

Let's break this down a bit, starting with the shared properties of these so-called NSR games. I think we all already know what having **"A GM"** means, so I'll move right along to **"A Weird Setting"**. To me, _Weird_ in the context of RPGs can mean a couple of things:
* A subversion of tropes, especially from the Fantasy and Science Fiction genres.
* The players may sometimes feel _unsettled_ by their interactions with the world.  
* Mystery and the unknown are major factors in play.

Not to be confused with [_Gonzo_](https://dungeonspossums.blogspot.com/2019/02/what-does-gonzo-mean-to-you.html) settings, the _Weird_ features characters trying to make sense of an increasingly confusing, abnormal, or terrifying world. Players are not expected to _conquer_ the world, but instead to try and overcome its inherit strangeness. As [The Luminescent Lich
](http://luminescentlich.blogspot.com/2017/06/the-gonzo-vs-weird.html) writes, it is through _the thrill of discovery and the atmosphere of the fantastic_ that the players experience _The Weird_ in play.

### Troika!
There is likely no better example of a _Weird Setting_ than [Troika!](https://www.troikarpg.com/), from Melsonian Arts Council. Troika's website describes the game via the following bullet points (relevant items left out):
* A science-fantasy universe in the spirit of works such as Dying Earth, Viriconium, and Book of the New Sun.
* No huge essays explaining the setting or lore! Everything you need to know is tucked away inside the items, spell, enemies and backgrounds.
* The freedom to allow and positively encourage every group of players to interact with the setting differently; each game group will be unique.
* 36 unique player character backgrounds from Ardent Giant of Corda to Zoanthrope​.

In his [review](https://cannibalhalflinggaming.com/2019/02/27/troika-review/) of Troika!, Aaron Marks of [Cannibal Halfing Gaming](https://cannibalhalflinggaming.com/); writes:

_"Imagine, if you will, that Douglas Adams and Terry Pratchett have returned from the dead. They both pile into a Ford Cortina and take a long drive across the American Southwest, pondering the nature of the fantasy genre. Once they arrive in California, they legally acquire several ounces of the finest cannabis sativa and hotbox the Cortina. Then they write an RPG."_

The esteemed David Schirduan wrote an excellent [character generator](https://technicalgrimoire.com/troikagenerator) for Troika! that really conveys the _strangeness_ of the system:

I can start the game with _Bridle of Aeons_? What does that mean? Time to find out!
