On December 21nd, [Shane Ivey](https://mobile.twitter.com/Pandatheist) published a short, simple entry on his blog [**Bone Box Chant**](https://boneboxchant.wordpress.com) called ["New School Revolution"](https://boneboxchant.wordpress.com/2019/12/21/nsr/). What I found so inspiring was how accurately he'd been able to describe the exact play style I preferred, without the classic snobbishness you might expect from such a thought-provoking piece.
I've reproduced the original definition here:

### NSR games have:
* A GM
* A Weird Setting
* A Living World

### are:
* Rules lite
* Deadly

### and focus on:
   - Emergent Narrative
   - External Interaction
   - Exploration
