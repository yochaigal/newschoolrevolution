On December 21nd, [Pandathiest](https://mobile.twitter.com/Pandatheist) published a short, simple entry on his blog [**Bone Box Chant**](https://boneboxchant.wordpress.com) called ["New School Revolution"](https://boneboxchant.wordpress.com/2019/12/21/nsr/). In the post, he creates a new label for a particular kind of play experience.

NSR games have:
   * A GM
   * A Weird Setting
   * A Living World

are:
   * Rules lite
   * Deadly

and focus on:
   * Emergent Narrative
   * External Interaction
   * Exploration
