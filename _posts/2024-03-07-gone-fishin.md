# Gone Fishin'

On today's episode of [Between Two Cairns](https://www.buzzsprout.com/2042709), we discussed a module called _Gone Fishin'_. We mentioned that it is kind of hard to find, and that the original sources were lost in a forest of dead links and old forum posts. Fortunately the original PDF includes the following text:

"This is a free product. Use this, abuse this, distribute this, host this, do whatever you wish with it - it’s all good. But please don’t be a douche and try to sell this. Free should be free."

With that knowledge, I'm happy to host the file [here](https://newschoolrevolution.com/files/gone-fishin.zip). Happy days.
