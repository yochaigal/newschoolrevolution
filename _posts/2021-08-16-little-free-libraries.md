# Little Free Libraries

Over the past month I have been "seeding" [Little Free Libraries](https://littlefreelibrary.org) all over town with RPGs, character sheets, dice and adventures. I've mostly been giving out [Cairn](https://cairnrpg.com) and [Rogueland](https://www.cavernsofheresy.com/product/rogueland). I'm prepping Maze Rats and Knave as well, likely to bundled with one page adventures.  

#### I've been including these "explainers" along with each dice bag:

### But, Why?

This was of course, not my idea. I think I first heard about it from [this](https://twitter.com/CavernsOfHeresy/status/1381273447909720067) CavernsOfHeresy tweet. Then I saw that [Roz](https://twitter.com/AllThingsTruly/status/1409201450090123267) had done it at least [twice](https://twitter.com/AllThingsTruly/status/1409881430977617930). Encouraged by their efforts, I reached out to CavernsOfHeresy (our games are friends since birth) and a deal was struck: I would send a "stack" of Cairns in exchange for a pile 'o Roguelands.

I then began the hunt. Although there is a semi-functional [website](https://littlefreelibrary.org/ourmap/) that lists local Little Free Libraries in my area, (just _waiting_ for me to pay a visit) I found that it was sorely out of date and difficult to use. Instead, I began to take note of their locations while driving, biking and walking about town. I also asked other locals (fun!) and had a hilarious conversation with Fiona (my NPC-Quest-Giver in this scenario) about their various hidden locations. Finally, I had a list of 14 locations in my town alone (so far)!

I ordered [these](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01476QV14) dice (20 bags for $30) as well as [these](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07XTDF6T8) bags (both the 6 x 9 and 8 x 10) varieties. In the end, I think I spent around $50, though I use the latter for sales of other products so it was no big deal. I printed out some nice character sheets, dropped the game and dice in a bag and...

#### They were ready to deliver!
