# Little Free Libraries

[![Alt text](/img/little-free-libraries/little_free_library4.jpg "click to embiggen"){:height="75%" width="75%"}](/img/little-free-libraries/little_free_library4.jpg)

Over the past month I have been "seeding" [Little Free Libraries](https://littlefreelibrary.org) all over town with RPGs, character sheets, dice and adventures. I've been giving out both [Cairn](https://cairnrpg.com) and [Rogueland](https://www.cavernsofheresy.com/product/rogueland) (the same versions you'd get from a store).

### But, why?
First, let me makes something plain: I'm not endorsing the LFL website/nonprofit, I'm simply taking advantage of their existence. FWIW, 90% of the little libraries around my town are _not_ affiliated with the organization. There are folks with [real](https://www.cbc.ca/radio/asithappens/as-it-happens-thursday-edition-1.4099293/toronto-librarian-makes-her-case-against-little-free-libraries-1.4099601) beef about these things, and that's worth considering. I do suggest that you reach out to the original authors of whatever games/adventures you distribute and make sure that they're cool with it, though.

All of my work is free, and will (likely) always be free. I am fortunate enough to not rely on this creative work for my income, as well as a strong believer in [Copyleft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copyleft). I may charge for my work in the future to pay for original art, of course (though I will certainly have an art-free zero cost version as well). All of my work is also [CC-BY-SA 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/deed.ast), and I provide the original assets for download whenever possible. That said, I still _pay_ to print my work (whether locally or via a print shop), and sell that for folks who want it. I use the proceeds to fund my ~RPG habit~ work. However, printing a deluxe version of my game in large quantities lowers the price considerably, to just over $1 per booklet. Thus spending $15 to bring 20 RPGs into people's hands isn't a big deal to me.

### OK, but how?
This was of course, not my idea. I think I first heard about it from [this](https://twitter.com/CavernsOfHeresy/status/1381273447909720067) CavernsOfHeresy tweet, using the **#IRLCommunityCopies** hashtag. Then I saw that [Roz](https://twitter.com/AllThingsTruly/status/1409201450090123267) had done it at least [twice](https://twitter.com/AllThingsTruly/status/1409881430977617930). Encouraged by their efforts, I reached out to CavernsOfHeresy (our games are friends since birth) and a deal was struck: I would send a "stack" of Cairns in exchange for a pile 'o Roguelands.

I then began the hunt. Although there is a semi-functional [website](https://littlefreelibrary.org/ourmap/) that lists local Little Free Libraries in my area, (just _waiting_ for me to pay a visit) I found that it was sorely out of date and difficult to use. Instead, I began to take note of their locations while driving, biking and walking about town. I also asked other locals (fun!) and had a hilarious conversation with another local creator (my NPC-Quest-Giver in this scenario) about their various hidden locations. Finally, I had a list of 14 locations in my town alone (so far)!

#### In process...

I ordered [these](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01476QV14) dice (20 bags for $30) as well as [these](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07XTDF6T8) bags (both the 6 x 9 and 8 x 10) varieties. In the end, I think I spent around $50, though I use the latter for sales of other products so it was no big deal. I printed out some nice character sheets, dropped the game and dice in a bag and:

#### I've also been including these "explainers" along with each dice bag:

### You can do it, too!
Thus far, I've given away about 14 "deluxe" copies of Cairn, along with 5 generously donated high-quality copies of Rogueland. I plan on donating about 5 a month going forward, and (if possible) will give some to the local library (assuming they let me). I plan on distributing a bunch of adventures (with permission) in the near future as well.

I highly recommend anyone give this sort of thing a shot, it's quite rewarding and interesting. And nothing beats that feeling of sneakily checking to see if someone has picked your game out of all the books! I mean, who wouldn't be drawn to a bag of dice, right?

If you do happen to try this out, please let me know! With pics!
