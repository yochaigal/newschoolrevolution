## What Is?

The Kickstarter for the Cairn 2e Box Set will "go live" for backers sometime in late March.  
Click [here](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1557907976/cairn-2e-boxed-set) to "follow" it!

## WHAT IS IN THE BOX?

### The Player's Guide

Featuring the same rules you already know but with some minor tweaks and clarifications, three new procedures for play, and 20 boutique backgrounds for generating interesting and weird characters. Also, a ton of really beautiful art from Keny Widjaja and Amanda Lee Franck!
This is available right now and is entering its final editing stages. This book will be available at cost as an add-on and in the future. And yes the text will still be CC-BY-SA 4.0!

### The Warden's Guide

Written by me, and illustrated by Ari-Matti Toivonen and Adam Hensley. This is the first "official" Cairn adventure, and part of an ongoing series with lots more to come. It's long! It's got lots going on! It's got dungeons!

### Tear-off Character Sheets!

### A GM Screen!

Unfortunately I'm not ready to give away the image to this just yet. But I can tell you it'll have five panels and folds up real nice...

Enough, go [follow](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1557907976/cairn-2e-boxed-set) this thing. 

Thanks!
