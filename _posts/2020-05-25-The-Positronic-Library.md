## The Positronic Library: new map and cover art!

I have completely remade my Into The Odd dungeon, The [Positronic Library](https://yochaigal.itch.io/the-positronic-library). With the help of [Francesco Zanieri](https://www.instagram.com/licopeoart), I've added a fully illustrated cover, as well as a complete dungeon map of the Library. I've also cleaned up a number of the room descriptions, and added a bit more worldbuilding to boot.

### Look!

Let me know your thoughts, and your experience running it. I'm truly proud of what we've done here.
