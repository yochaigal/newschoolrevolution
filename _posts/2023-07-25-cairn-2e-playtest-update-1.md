# Cairn 2e Playtest: Update One

A [few weeks ago](/_posts/2023-07-10-cairn-2e-playtest.md) I released the Player's Guide playtest, an 80+ page rulebook for the upcoming Cairn 2nd edition. Since that time, I've received a _flood_ of positive (and occasionally negative) feedback, including typos, questions about some of the new rules and procedures, play reports, and so on. This has all been _extremely_ helpful to say the least, and as such we are ready to release the first updated PDF, incorporating much of what we've learned from the community. Once again, [sign-up here](https://tinyurl.com/cairn2e-news) if you’d like to get notified about future releases, the Kickstarter, and so on.

## The Changes

Here is an incomplete list of what to expect:

### General Fixes

- Typos, mostly in Backgrounds
- Fixed items missing _petty_ and _bulky_ tags
- Merged Inventory Rules with Character Creation
- Rewrote Hirelings creation process
- Rewrote character creation intro, changed subheadings
- Renamed Ability Scores to Attributes... everywhere?
- Rewrote Marketplace! Collapsed common items into groups for maximum flexibility
- Clarified weirdness with carts/donkeys
- Lots of little things

### Combat

- Clarified Scars (fingers crossed)
- Clarified Critical Damage
- Rewrote rounds/turns in Combat, esp. around "Initiative"

### Procedures

- Rewrote/clarified Dungeon Turns
- Rewrote dungeon movement/actions
- Rewrote dungeon events table triggers
- Rewrote/simplified dungeon exploration cycle
- Clarified Difficulty in Wilderness Exploration
- Removed references to Surprise
- Removed extraneous Panic from Wilderness Exploration
- Clarified "Getting Lost" in Wilderness Exploration (e.g. 1-in-6, 2-in-6)

## Feedback

This time around I've created a more formal feedback intake process. Here is what we are looking for right now:  
- Obvious typos
- Rules clarification
- Play reports

Additionally, we are asking that feedback is only submitted in one of two ways:  
- By filling out [this form](https://tinyurl.com/2e-feedback) (given the format, this is the best way to submit typos or rules clarifications).
- As a post or comment in the [Cairn Discord’s](https://discord.io/newschoolrevolution) dedicated 2e-feedback forum (this is the ideal place for play reports).
