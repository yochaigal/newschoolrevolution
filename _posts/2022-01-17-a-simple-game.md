# A Simple Game
My son is 5 this April. Like most kids he _loves_ games, particularly any that involve fantasy violence.

## What is a game?

## What makes a game _good_?

### [Game Name]
My son and I have been wrote this game together. It's pretty simple, uses minis/game pieces, wooden blocks, and can be played with or without a GM. Adventurers explore a dungeon or cool location, searching for treasure and fighting monsters.

#### Setup
Build a dungeon. You can use any blocks you like! [Ben Milton](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQ-ccPthhDY) recently recommended [these](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00XV13FQG), but any will do. Jenga blocks make good walls.

Populate the dungeon with monsters. We've used pieces from other board games for the monsters, treasure, and traps (if you like). If you have minis, now is your chance to use them!

Finally, come up with a reason for the Adventurers to explore the dungeon. Here are a few I've used:
- To find treasure (gold, items & scrolls)
- To rescue a kidnapped friend
- To explore a new place

#### Basic Rules
- Adventurers & Monsters have Health Points (HP) and bonuses. No other stats.
- On their turn, an Adventurer can move _and_ take an action/attack.
- If an adventurer takes a risky action, they roll a d6. On a 5-6 they are successful.
- Add +1 to the roll if an Adventurer has an item or skill that can help them succeed. Otherwise, they automatically succeed.

#### Spells & Magic
- Spellbooks contain a short list of spells. Reading a spellbook takes a single action.
- Spells can be cast once per adventure and do not require a roll to succeed.
- Common spells: Fireball, Fly, Fog Cloud, Freeze, Heal, Shapeshift, Sleep.  
- Scrolls are single-use spells not typically found in spellbooks.  

#### Combat
- Initiative: at the start of combat both sides roll a d6, the higher goes first.
- Each "side" takes turns. Adventurers and monsters go in whatever order they wish.
- Attackers roll a d6; on a 5-6 they are successful. Some weapons or abilities provide a single +1 bonus to the attack.

#### Adventurers
- Fighter: 6 HP, Sword (makes two separate attacks)
- Ranger: 5 HP, +1 Bow (ranged attacks), pet (owl, wolf, etc)
- Thief: 4 HP, Throwing Daggers, lockpicks, quick (+1 to initiative roll)
- Magic-User: 3 HP, Staff, Spellbook (4 spells)

#### Monsters
- Goblin: 2 HP, Sword, group (initiative bonus in groups of 3 or more)
- Lizardkin: 3 HP, Sword & Shield, roar (calls other Lizardkin)
- Ogre: 6 HP, Club (attack hit 2 targets)
- Assassin: 4 HP, Poison Bow (+1 to ranged attacks)
- Sorcerer: 3 HP, Spellbook (2 spells)
- Shadow Monster: 1 HP, mimics an Adventurer and their abilities/weapons
