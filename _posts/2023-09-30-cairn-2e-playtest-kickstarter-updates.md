## Playtest Status

[Earlier this year](https://newschoolrevolution.com/2023/07/10/cairn-2e-playtest) we released the first update to our Player's Guide, an 80+ page rulebook for the upcoming Cairn 2nd edition. Since that time, we've been very busy [playtesting](https://widdershinswanderings.bearblog.dev/blog/?q=Cairn%202e%20playtest), fixing typos, testing new procedures, and working on the Warden's Guide. 

Once again, [sign-up here](https://tinyurl.com/cairn2e-news) if you’d like to get notified about future releases, the Kickstarter, and so on.

## Get The PDF

As usual, the player's guide [playtest URL](https://tinyurl.com/cairn-2e-player) has not changed.

## Changes

- **New**: Downtime procedures
- Two new character sheets!
- Typos, mostly in Backgrounds
- Fixed items missing _petty_ and _bulky_ tags
- Spellbooks have been moved to the Warden's Guide
- Spellbook descriptions now appear in relevant backgrounds
- Clarified Scars AGAIN (this is becoming the [Herobrine](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Herobrine) of 2e)

## Feedback

We are still interested the following types of feedback:
- Obvious typos
- Rules clarification
- Play reports

Additionally, we are asking that feedback is only submitted in one of two ways:  
- By filling out [this form](https://tinyurl.com/2e-feedback) (given the format, this is the best way to submit typos or rules clarifications).
- As a post or comment in the [Cairn Discord’s](https://discord.io/cairn) dedicated 2e-feedback forum (this is the ideal place for play reports).
