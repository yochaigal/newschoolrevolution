## Cairn 2e KS Updates!

First, the good news: Cairn 2e has a new publisher! Earlier this year, we were very sad to learn that LFOSR would no longer be able to publish the Cairn 2e box set! Well, we are very happy to officially announce that [**Space Penguin Ink**](https://spacepenguin.ink/) will be our new publisher! We are so excited to be working with them, and frankly we can't imagine doing it any other way. They have the expertise and skills to make this thing really sing... and that's where the bad news comes in. We have decided _delay_ the Kickstarter until March, 2024.

SHOCKING!

I know, I know. Honestly, pushing it forward (or is it back... I always forget?) will ensure that the box set is everything we want it to be — and more. A few more updates:

- Amanda Lee Franck has been hired to do some interior art & a bestiary for the Warden's Guide
- The online character generator/Keeper is nearing beta
- Art for backgrounds is expected in early November
- Writing for the Warden's Guide is in full swing

### Basic Box Set

The contents of the box set have not changed, but I am happy to deliver on some details around its contents at this time:  
- Player's Guide (staple-bound if possible)
- Warden's Guide (hardcover chonky boy)
- Tear-off character sheets
- Starting adventure
- Optional extra copies of the Player's Guide, printed _at cost_

#### Stretch Goals We Might Cram In At No Extra Cost

- GM screen by Bruno Prosaiko
- Adventure anthology (Brad Kerr, Amanda P. Zedeck Siew... and more!)
- Online Setting generator
- Arts-n-craft tokens
- Localization (as many languages as we can)

## Playtest Status

[Earlier this year](https://newschoolrevolution.com/2023/07/10/cairn-2e-playtest) we released the first update to our Player's Guide, an 80+ page rulebook for the upcoming Cairn 2nd edition. Since that time, we've been very busy [playtesting](https://widdershinswanderings.bearblog.dev/blog/?q=Cairn%202e%20playtest), fixing typos, testing new procedures, and working on the Warden's Guide. 

Once again, [sign-up here](https://tinyurl.com/cairn2e-news) if you’d like to get notified about future releases, the Kickstarter, and so on.

### Get The PDF

The player's guide [playtest URL](https://tinyurl.com/cairn-2e-player) is still the same.

### Changes

- **New**: Downtime procedures
- Two new [character sheets](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1tvRA6CBBqJ54mJuyRbfWpAtt43I18CHe?usp=sharing)!
- Typos, mostly in Backgrounds
- "Balancing" in backgrounds (inventory slots, items)
- Skin changes! Check them out
- Fixed items missing _petty_ and _bulky_ tags
- Lots of rules clarification around damage, combat, and dying
- Spellbooks have been moved to the Warden's Guide
- Spellbook descriptions now appear in relevant backgrounds
- Clarified Scars AGAIN (this is becoming the [Herobrine](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Herobrine) of 2e)

### Feedback

We are still interested the following types of feedback:
- Obvious typos
- Rules clarification
- Play reports

Additionally, we are asking that feedback is only submitted in one of two ways:  
- By filling out [this form](https://tinyurl.com/2e-feedback) (given the format, this is the best way to submit typos or rules clarifications).
- As a post or comment in the [Cairn Discord’s](https://discord.io/cairn) dedicated 2e-feedback forum (this is the ideal place for play reports).
