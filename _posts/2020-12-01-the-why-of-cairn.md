In a recent Twitter thread, I spelled out some of my thinking behind designing [Cairn], prompted by a misreading of a comment by [wereoctopus]. I decided to clean it up a bit and republish that diatribe here.

## In The Beginning

My design sensibilities came out of the [PbtA] world, where Principles, Agendas and Moves guided a games playstyle. I think principles and guidelines help play, because they set the expectations (just like safety tools). PbtA games use mechanics to emphasize playstyle. One could argue that OSR games do this as well, but I think is is less explicit. In short, PbtA games _have more rules_, but those rules tend to be focused on _enforcing a playstyle_. I think the best - and perhaps most masterful - example of this is [Monsterhearts 2e]. From a design point of view I think it's brilliant, although it isn't really a game that speaks to me.  

After a few years, I discovered that the enforced playstyle common to most PbtA games was stifling for the type of experience I preferred; namely problem solving, critical thinking, exploration, and the emergent narrative. Obviously many of those goals can be achieved in almost any system, but personally I felt that most PbtA games, and especially Dungeon World, were not for me.  

I began to seek other avenues. In my journey, I discovered a wide variety of indie RPGs, too many to list here. Eventually, I found my comfort zone in a weird hybrid OSR space; see the original [NSR] link that spawned this blog for more on that.

I remember reading about [Into The Odd] over a year before I actually ran it. It stuck in my brain, like a thorn. I recall telling myself: "If I read this game, I will probably switch all of my games over to it. But I'm _so_ busy, maybe later!" Eventually, I bought the print-on-demand PDF (not the neat Lost Pages one, unfortunately) and found it to be a very rules-lite game, brilliant both for its simplicity and its breadth of scope. Here was a game that took all of 5-10 minutes to teach, and yet had rules for _only the things that mattered_. Everything else was up to the table. But more importantly, it seemed to satisfy the goals I listed earlier better than almost anything I'd come up against (here's looking at you, [Troika!]). I ran it, and was hooked. By the way, the starting dungeon (_The Iron Coral_) is one of the easiest adventures I've ever read. I really wish Chris could sell it separately.

I dived in and never looked back; glad for what I'd learned, but even gladder that I'd never need to memorize a class move again. When its successor, Electric Bastionland came out, it was like finding a room in my head that I didn't realize had been there all along; a light had been switched on, and the cobwebs dusted away.

## Electric Bastionland

Putting aside the beauty of the game's character generation (more on _Failed Careers_ later), the advice found in the GM section was like a lightning rod to my brain. I am forever indebted to the chapters called _The ICI Doctrine_, _Informed Danger & Death_ and _The Conductor is a Game Designer_. But more importantly, the chapter called _Foreground Growth_ was probably the most eye-opening.

"Think of character change as growth, rather than advancement. You're becoming more distinct, more interesting, and getting more options as you progress, rather than becoming more numerically powerful."

In my actual EB campaign(s), diagetic growth (to use a popular buzzword) really shines. PCs are changed (mechanically or otherwise) by their actual in-game experiences. And as a result, my players were more invested & appreciative than in any other games I'd ever played. I'll borrow an example I've posted about elsewhere:

Towards the end of my [Weird West] Electric Bastionland campaign, one of the PCs had extracted the consciousness of a defeated enemy using the _essence extractor_ found in the core rulebook. There, standing over the still-living body of a powerful - yet defeated - former foe, we all waited to see what the Player would have his character do. Surprising us all, he decided to drank the man's soul. I had not anticipated this turn of events, and needed to think quickly on how this might work out. The enemy was a serious tough guy; high Charisma, physically very strong, and pretty damn evil.

In true OSR fashion, I made a ruling. The PC would swap their abysmally low CHA with that of his foe. However, I also ruled that going forward, he would to make regular saves to prevent his new, brutish _inner_ spirit from taking over, particularly when faced with an opponent that was rendered helpless.

Such stories are not unique to ItO/EB. However, here was the first time I'd seen it proscribed in the game's advice, and thus felt license to start implementing. There are no XP or Levels in Electric Bastionland. And thus forth I decided that was how I would handle any kind of advancement: purely through the fiction.  

Chris delivered answers to questions that had plagued me for years, and did so in his succinct, matter-of-fact way. Don't ask "how much information should I give the players?", he'd say. Instead ask, "What do secrets really give us? These games are about _choice_, and the one cannot truly be free to choose without maximal information." Instead of asking, "How much experience should a PC get for killing the big bad guy?" Chris would ask, "What monsters did they slay within? How were they changed by their experiences? What does that growth _look_ like?"

These are but bits and pieces of the solid advice found in that weighty tome; if you haven't read it already, I strongly suggest you stop reading these words, and go grab a copy now. The whole thing is only about 2 pages of rules! The remainder is made up of 100 beautifully-illustrated Failed Careers, followed by examples and play advice. If I could remake Cairn, I'd probably do something akin [this](https://aboleth-overlords.com/?s=backgrounds) excellent series of EB-minspired Backgrounds taken from Knave. Ah, well.

## Cairn

As you can guess, I fell in love with Into The Odd, and Electric Bastionland especially; the mechanics and setting worked really well with the kinds of games I wanted to run, and stories I wanted to explore. Even better, both of these systems - while somewhat hardcoded to a specific setting, were also easily adaptable to any number of _other_ types of worldbuilding.

felt easy to adapt for traditional D&D modules, and especially the incredible Dolmenwood setting by
@NecroticGnome. It was doable, but not perfect.

Meanwhile, Knave & Maze Rats (and their descendants) were a thing. But Knave had levels & 6 stats MR was just as difficult to adapt for what I wanted to run - Village of Hommlet, Wormskin,  etc. I wanted GMs to see "Scroll of Haste" and just have something they could drop in.

I loved Mausritter, which was is fantasy, but it was for.. mice. So I thought: what if I borrowed some bits from there, using Knave's chargen as a base. I added some principles (modified from Weird North, which I worked on) and... there it was. A D&D-like Into The Odd hack.

I wanted to do a lot more with Cairn, but I gave myself a week to write it. I've run about a dozen sessions with it so far, mostly Dolmenwood and related materials. I will likely publish an adventure and bestiary in the future.
Sorry for the diatribe! Thanks for reading.
