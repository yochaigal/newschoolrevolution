In a recent Twitter thread, I spelled out some of my thinking behind designing [Cairn](https://yochaigal.itch.io/cairn), prompted by a misreading of a comment by [wereoctopus](https://twitter.com/wereoctopus/status/1333661093630152704). I decided to clean it up a bit and republish that diatribe here.

## In The Beginning

My design sensibilities came out of the [PbtA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Powered_by_the_Apocalypse) world, where Principles, Agendas and Moves helped not only to guide particular playstyle, but also to reinforce the overarching themes of the game. I think principles and guidelines help play, because they set the expectations (just like safety tools). PbtA games use mechanics to emphasize playstyle. One could argue that OSR games do this as well, but I think is is less explicit. In short, PbtA games _have more rules_, but those rules tend to be focused on _enforcing a playstyle_. I think the most exemplary example of this is the game [Monsterhearts 2](https://buriedwithoutceremony.com/monsterhearts) by Avery Alder. From a design point of view I think it's brilliant, although it isn't really a game that speaks to me.  

After a few years, I discovered that the enforced playstyle common to most PbtA games was stifling for the type of experience I preferred; namely problem solving, critical thinking, exploration, and the emergent narrative. Obviously many of those goals can be achieved in almost any system, but personally I felt that most PbtA games, and especially Dungeon World, were not for me.  

I began to seek other avenues. In my journey, I discovered a wide variety of indie RPGs, too many to list here. Eventually, I found my comfort zone in a weird hybrid OSR space; see the original NSR  [post](https://boneboxchant.wordpress.com/2019/12/21/nsr/) that spawned this blog for more on that.

I remember reading about [Into The Odd](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/145536/Into-the-Odd) over a year before I actually ran it. It stuck in my brain, like a thorn. I recall telling myself: "If I read this game, I will probably switch all of my games over to it. But I'm _so_ busy, maybe later!" Eventually, I bought the print-on-demand PDF (not the neat Lost Pages one, unfortunately) and found it to be a just what I was looking for; a game brilliant both for its simplicity as well as its flexibility. Here was a game that took all of 5-10 minutes to teach, and yet had rules for _only the things that mattered_. Everything else was up to the table. But more importantly, it seemed to satisfy the goals I listed earlier better than almost anything I'd come up against (here's looking at you, Troika!).

I ran it once, and was hooked. The starting dungeon (_The Iron Coral_) is one of the easiest adventures I've ever read, btw. I really wish Chris could sell it separately.

I dived in and never looked back; glad for what I'd learned, but even gladder that I'd never need to memorize a class move again.

## Electric Bastionland

When its successor, _[Electric Bastionland](https://bastionlandpress.com/)_ came out, it was like finding a room in my head that I didn't realize had been there all along; a light had been switched on, and the cobwebs dusted away. The _Failed Careers_ alone are worth the price of admission; I could stare at the book's glorious art all day. As an aside, if I could remake Cairn, I'd probably do something akin to [this](https://aboleth-overlords.com/?s=backgrounds) excellent series of EB-inspired Backgrounds taken from Knave. Ah, well.

Putting aside the beauty of the game's character generation (I could write a whole post just about that), the advice found in the GM section was like a lightning rod to my brain.

Chris delivered answers to questions that had plagued me for years, and did so in his succinct, matter-of-fact way.
"Wow much information should I give the players?", I might wonder.

And he'd say, "_What do secrets really give us? Aren't we better off without them? If these kinds of games are meant to be about choice, how can one truly choose freely without maximal information?_"

"Fine," I might say. "But how much experience should a PC get for killing the big bad guy? Where are my level ups at?" And Chris would say, "_What monsters did they slay within? How were they changed by their experiences? Why must growth always mean that you get better?_"

These are but bits and pieces of the solid advice found in that weighty tome; if you haven't read it already, I strongly suggest you stop reading these words, and go grab a copy now. The whole thing is only about 2 pages of rules! The remainder is made up of 100 beautifully-illustrated Failed Careers, followed by examples and play advice.

 I am forever indebted to chapters like the **The ICI Doctrine**, **Informed Danger & Death** and **The Conductor is a Game Designer**. However, the most eye-opening to me was the chapter called **Foreground Growth**.

"_Think of character change as growth, rather than advancement. You're becoming more distinct, more interesting, and getting more options as you progress, rather than becoming more numerically powerful._"

In my actual EB campaign(s), diagetic growth (to use a popular buzzword) really shines. PCs are changed (mechanically or otherwise) by their actual in-game experiences. There are no XP or Levels in Electric Bastionland. And thus forth I decided that was how I would handle any kind of advancement: purely through the fiction. And as a result, my players were more invested & appreciative than in any other games I'd ever played. I'll borrow an example I've posted about elsewhere:

Towards the end of my [Weird West](https://yochaigal.itch.io/the-clay-shelf) Electric Bastionland campaign, one of the PCs had extracted the consciousness of a defeated enemy using the _essence extractor_ found in the core rulebook. There, standing over the still-living body of a powerful - yet defeated - former foe, we all waited to see what the Player would have his character do. Surprising us all, he decided to drank the man's soul. I had not anticipated this turn of events, and needed to think quickly on how this might work out. The enemy was a serious tough guy; high Charisma, physically very strong, and pretty damn evil.

In true OSR fashion, I made a ruling. The PC would swap their abysmally low CHA with that of his foe. However, I also ruled that going forward, he would to make regular saves to prevent his new, brutish _inner_ spirit from taking over, particularly when faced with an opponent that was rendered helpless.

Such experiences are not unique to ItO/EB. However, here was the first time I'd seen it proscribed directly in the game's rules & advice section, and as a result, felt license to really try my hand at it.

## Cairn

As you can guess, I fell in love with Into The Odd, and Electric Bastionland especially; the mechanics and setting worked really well with the kinds of games I wanted to run, as well as the stories I wanted to explore. Even better, both of these systems (while somewhat hardcoded to a specific setting) were also easily adaptable to any number of _other_ types of worldbuilding, with minor [hacking](https://yochaigal.github.io/intotheodd/hacks.html).

I had hoped to run modules like Village of Hommlet, Wormskin, Evils of Illmire, etc. However, when I saw entries like "Behind the cupboard is a Scroll of Haste," I knew there was a problem: Spells. Without a proper spellcasting or magic system, I might need to spend a lot more time converting than I was comfortable with. I wanted something that I could just drop in.

However, there weren't a _lot_ of Into The Odd hacks that I felt it would be easy to run more traditional D&D modules, and especially the incredible Dolmenwood setting by [Necrotic Gnome](https://necroticgnome.com/). I had run two campaigns of the excellent [Into The Dungeon: Revived](https://vladar4.github.io/itdr/) but had never felt totally comfortable with it; somehow my preference for in-world, level-less growth & classless gaming still gnawed at my enjoyment.  

Meanwhile, Knave & Maze Rats (and their descendants) were a thing. Designed by the brilliant Ben Milton of Questing Beast fame, these systems had fascinating rules, robust tables and were borne of a barebones, do-it-yourself philosophy. But Knave still had levels, 6 stats (3 too many!), while Maze Rats was too far afield and (dare I say) rules-lite for what easily converting old school modules.

I loved Mausritter, which was is fantasy, but it was for.. mice. So I thought: what if I borrowed some bits from there, using Knave's chargen as a base. I added some principles (modified from Weird North, which I worked on) and... there it was. A D&D-like Into The Odd hack.

I wanted to do a lot more with Cairn, but I gave myself a week to write it. I've run about a dozen sessions with it so far, mostly Dolmenwood and related materials. I will likely publish an adventure and bestiary in the future.
Sorry for the diatribe! Thanks for reading.
