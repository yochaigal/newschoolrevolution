Our month-long [Eclectic Bastion Jam](https://itch.io/jam/eclectic-bastion-jam) is finally over!  

The Jam was a resounding success, with 61 entries in total (though I'm aware of a few submissions that didn't make the deadline). We had everything from short (but sweet) Failed Careers to 80+ page total hacks. There are far too many excellent submissions for me cover here, but I have taken the liberty of organizing the entries into their respective categories.
