Our month-long [Eclectic Bastion Jam](https://itch.io/jam/eclectic-bastion-jam) is finally over!  The Jam was a resounding success, with 61 entries in total (though I'm aware of a few submissions that didn't make the deadline). We had everything from short (but sweet) Failed Careers to 80+ page total hacks. There are far too many excellent submissions for me cover here, but there were a few notable highlights I'd like to draw your attention to.

# Failed Careers/Backgrounds

### Electric Wizards

# NPCs
### Fifty Bastionards

# Adventures
### The Clay Shelf

# Boroughs
### The Far Wharf

# Games Based on Into The Odd
### Weird North

### ANNA-X66

### QZ

### The Labyrinth of Verra
