The mods of the Into The Odd Discord (which includes me) are throwing a month-long "Eclectic Bastion Jam" over at [Itch.io](https://itch.io/jam/eclectic-bastion-jam). That means folks are being encouraged to create hacks, adventures, dungeons, failed careers, etc for Into The Odd: Electric Bastionland and submit them. There is no prize, nor is there any judging/ranking. Our initial goals were to increase the amount of content and hacks available for this incredible system (thought the latter is _well_ [established](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ipMsbNE5EH6-1_d58o_JfneF2XA4yWqfr5XxJInSzqI/edit#bookmark=id.a7zji32jrcr2) already).

It started Thursday night, but I was out of town so I'm a bit late to the party. So far we have over 100 participants! That's exciting.

Please: join in! It doesn't matter if you've never created anything Into The Odd or even RPG related before.
