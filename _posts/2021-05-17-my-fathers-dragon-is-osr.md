# My Father's Dragon is OSR

Recently I've been reading a book series to my son each night before bed. The book is "My Father's Dragon" by Ruth Stiles Gannett (with illustrations by her mother-in-law, Ruth Chrisman Gannett).

The books are _totally_ aligned with OSR Principles as according to the [Principia Apocrypha](https://lithyscaphe.blogspot.com/p/principia-apocrypha.html).

First let's start with the map:

The book is about a boy who travels to an island to free an enslaved baby dragon.
The dragon is being used to ferry animals across a river (see map).
The boy lands on the West side, getting to the island by crossing rocks (and a sleeping whale).

The first thing you should all know is that everything on the island:
- Talks
- Wants to kill him

The protagonist (Elmer Elevator) is quite savvy, however. He came prepared, with a filled knapsack.
They explicitly list what he has in his inventory multiple times during the story.

These items come into heavy use through the story.
He doesn't have a map of the island! He also doesn't know exactly where the dragon is, but he knows it's near the river, and that the river meets the sea.
So what does he do? He travels south along the beach, till he meets the place where the river meets the sea . Of course he doesn't get that far, because along the way he encounters a bunch of animals, all of whom want to kill him. He's stealthy, but he makes one serious mistake: He leaves behind food scraps (tangerine peels), which the animals know means there is an "invader" on the island. Then they begin hunting him.
As he encounters each creature, he tries to avoid direct engagement each time. Instead, he hides or distracts them. At one point he impersonates a monkey, though this didn't quite work out for him.
When he finally is forced to directly engage, he uses intelligence and cunning, along with all his inventory items to find clever solutions.

## An example:
He is surrounded by seven tigers, all of whom wish to kill him. He offers them all gum, but they argue that they can just kill him and take his gum. But then he tells them that this gum is special, if you eat it for a long time it turns green, at which point it can be planted, making gum trees grow. This is all lies. He gets the tigers to stare into each other's mouths, trying to see if their gum has turned green yet. While they are distracted, he escapes.

After that, he drinks water from a special pool controlled by a rhino, who then informs Elmer that his death shall come for his actions. But the boy talks to the rhino, who opens up about how sad he is on account of his horn being super dirty and old. The boy shows him how to use toothpaste and a toothbrush to clean it up and make it white. He then escapes.

The best part is when he finally finds the river but the dragon is on the other side.
So he convinces 17 alligator to create a bridge for him by giving each a lollipop (tied to their tails via a rubberband) and having them bite the tail of the alligator in front of him.

My favorite part however is when he gets to the other side, the animals follow him across the "bridge". He isn't able to cut through the dragon's rope quickly enough, so he tells the dragon, "Don't worry, if they come over here we'll fly across, leaving them on this side. Then, I'll finish cutting the rope!"
That doesn't end up happening but I love that he considered all options.

There is more, but my fundamental argument here is that it teaches three important OSR lessons:
• Problem solving is more important than direct engagement
• Exploration is exciting
• Critical thinking is key to overcoming obstacles
• You are your items. Find ways to use them and you may yet survive
