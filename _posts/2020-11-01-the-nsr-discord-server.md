I have opened the NSR Discord server to the general public. Folks interested in playing in games, running games or just chatting RPG theory, please join in!
<br> <br>We already have about a dozen games running (mostly Play By Post, but some voice!) and our friendly Admins are happy to setup new games for those interested.
