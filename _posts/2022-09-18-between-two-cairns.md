# Between Two Cairns

I have a podcast!  
It's called [Between Two Cairns]([link](https://www.buzzsprout.com/2042709)). It is co-hosted by [Brad Kerr](https://brad-kerr.itch.io/), creator of many popular OSR products. Each week we'll be discussing a new RPG product (adventure, dungeon, etc), with an aim to shed some light on stuff we think is cool or deserving of attention (even if we don't necessarily like it)! There are presently two episodes to download. Have a listen!
