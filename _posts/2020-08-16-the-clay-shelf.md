[The Clay Shelf](https://yochaigal.itch.io/the-clay-shelf) is an adventure I wrote for [Into The Odd: Electric Bastionland](https://chrismcdee.itch.io/electric-bastionland), set in the **Deep Country**, far from the civilized domains of **Bastion**. As usual, it's free to download, and prints into a nice little booklet! It was also my submission to [Eclectic Bastion Jam](https://itch.io/jam/eclectic-bastion-jam), which I wrote a little about [here](https://newschoolrevolution.com/2020/08/15/eclectic-bastion-jam-is-over) and [here](https://newschoolrevolution.com/2020/07/11/eclectic-bastion-jam).

I'm particularly proud of this one. It grew from a long-running Play By Post (still ongoing!), playtested by the same players that I ran through my [Positronic Library](https://yochaigal.itch.io/the-positronic-library). Perhaps I'll blog about how that all works someday soon.
