# The Dungeon Game
My son is 5 this April. Like most kids he _loves_ games, particularly any that involve a high level of freedom along with a generous helping of pretend violence. Unsurprisingly, I've encouraged him to express his interests through the classic dungeon crawl, built from simple rules borrowed from indie RPGs. Together we build a dungeon, assemble a party, and fight monsters. Sometimes we give the monsters jelly beans. At the end we share in the spoils (for some reason, this was super important to my kid). If you want to jump to the rules, [skip ahead](#the-dungeon-game).

## What is a game?
Ha, what a title! OK so here's the deal: a game is a kind of play that has semi-consistent rules. Easy, and no one is left out. That said...

## What makes a game _interesting_?
I'm afraid I've become a bit of a snob the past few years, especially when it comes to games designed for children. My son has been making up games since he was two years old and playing roleplaying and board games since he was three. He isn't special in this regard, either: play is something for which children seem to need _no_ instruction. Many of his friends play games above the recommended age indicated by the box; the only distinction in capability appears to be familiarity with the core concepts (e.g. how many games they've previously played)

It seems like the board games boast that they help teach children important lessons through play, including cooperation, critical thinking, patience, etc. Although these sorts of games tend to teach the basics pretty well (taking turns, numbers mean things, etc) they rarely foster fun, long-term play. Frequently, these kinds of games fail to consider one thing that children (and adults) really do care about: **Agency**. What makes a game _interesting_ (and fun) is the level of decision-making agency a player has each turn, and most children's games seem to have forgotten this.

In many games the results of play are pre-determined: in _Candyland_, the game session has already been written once the cards are shuffled. In _Count Your Chickens_, a spinner is used to determine the next move, and the next, and so on. There is no input from the players; a robot arm could shuffle the deck or flick the spinner and the results would unfold exactly the same way. There is no strategy, logic, or decision-making on the part of the player.

This does not mean that these games have no value; _Candyland_ is a great structure for learning the basics: turns, pieces, cards, etc. It has a [fine history](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2019/07/how-polio-inspired-the-creation-of-candy-land/594424/) as well. But the basic structure has been repeated in other games, sometimes with simple changes (dice for cards, apples for candy). I feel like children eventually tire of these sorts of games, moving toward mixed systems like _Sorry!_, and (hopefully) later on towards play experiences built around skill, player choice, and imagination.

I am fortunate that my child quickly moved on from the agency-free games and into competitive and cooperative games of skill and chance. If you're curious, here are a few that we like:

- _Amazing Tales_
- _Hoot Owl Hoot_
- _Sequence (for kids)_
- _Sorry!_
- _Race to the Treasure_
- _Rivers, Roads, Rails_
- _Outfoxed!_
- _Parcheesi_

### The Dungeon Game
My son and I wrote this game together. It's pretty simple, uses minis/game pieces and wooden blocks and can be played with or without a GM. Adventurers explore a dungeon or cool location, searching for treasure and fighting monsters. I don't really like "suggested ages" or whatever, but 3 and up seems like a solid range.

#### Setup
Build a dungeon. You can use any blocks you like! [Ben Milton](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQ-ccPthhDY) recently recommended [these](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00XV13FQG), but any will do. Jenga blocks make good walls.

Populate the dungeon with monsters. We've used pieces from other board games for the monsters, treasure, and traps (if you like). If you have minis, now is your chance to use them!

_Most importantly_ get some real **treasure**. Licorice, fruit, chocolate coins, whatever. Put it all in a cup or bowl and put it to one side, with instructions that it not be touched until the adventure is concluded.

Finally, come up with a reason for the Adventurers to explore the dungeon. Here are a few I've used:
- To find treasure (gold, items & scrolls)
- To rescue a kidnapped friend
- To explore a new place

#### Basic Rules
- Adventurers & Monsters have Health Points (HP) and bonuses. No other stats.
- On their turn, an Adventurer can move _and_ take an action/attack.
- If an adventurer takes a risky action, they roll a d6. On a 5-6 they are successful.
- Add a maximum of +1 to the roll if an Adventurer has an item or skill that can help them succeed.
- Any action is possible, even during combat. The fancier the action, the greater the consequences of failure (explained in advance). Make a determination as a group whether a +1 should be added to the roll.

#### Spells & Magic
- **Spellbooks** contain a short list of spells. Reading a spellbook takes a single action.
- Spells can be cast once per adventure and do not require a roll to succeed.
- Using a spell _beyond_ its basic description (e.g. Sleep on multiple targets) can require a roll.
- Common spells: Fireball (2 damage), Fly, Fog Cloud, Freeze, Heal, Shapeshift, Sleep.  
- **Scrolls** are single-use spells not typically found in spellbooks.  

#### Combat
- **Initiative**: at the start of combat both sides roll a d6, the higher goes first.
- Each "side" takes turns. Adventurers and monsters go in whatever order they wish.
- Attackers roll a d6; on a 5-6 they are successful. Some weapons or abilities provide a single +1 bonus to the attack.
- Normal attacks do 1 HP of damage unless otherwise indicated.
- **Healing**: Adventurers can return to a place of safety and wait a turn to make a healing roll. On a 5-6 they regain 1 HP. Monsters may catch up to them during this time!

#### Adventurers
- **Knight**: 8 HP, Broad Sword (+1 to attack rolls), Shield
- **Fighter**: 6 HP, Dual Swords (attacks two targets), quick (+1 to party initiative roll)
- **Ranger**: 5 HP, +1 Bow, 3 poison arrows (2 damage), hand axe, pet (owl, wolf, etc)
- **Thief**: 4 HP, Dual Daggers (+1 when thrown), lockpicks, +1 to sneaking maneuvers

#### Monsters
- **Shadow Monster**: n HP, mimics an Adventurer and their HP/abilities/weapons

#### Treasure

- **Globe of Water-Walking**: Allows you to walk on water as long as you can hold your breath.
- **Pocket-Wall**: A small tube of clay that spreads to cover any opening.
- **Magic Rope**: A fifty-foot rope that follows the commands of its holder.
- **Crystal Eyes**: Goggles that allow for 360 degree view allowing the wearer to always go before monsters (even if the Adventurer's fail initiative)
- **Pocket Dimension**: Sucks objects and creatures into a portal, then itself.
