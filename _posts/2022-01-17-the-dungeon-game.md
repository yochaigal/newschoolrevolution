# The Dungeon Game
My son is 5 this April. Like most kids he _loves_ games, particularly any that involve a high level of freedom along with a generous helping of pretend violence. Unsurprisingly, I've encouraged him to express his interests through the classic dungeon crawl, built from simple rules borrowed from indie RPGs. Together we build a dungeon, assemble a party and fight monsters. Sometimes we give the monsters jelly beans. At the end share in the spoils (for some reason, this was super important to my kid). If you want to read the rules, [skip ahead](#the-dungeon-game).

## What is a game?
Ha, what a title! OK so here's the deal: a game is a kind of play that has semi-consistent rules. Easy, and no one is left out. That said...

## What makes a game _interesting_?
I'm afraid I've become a bit of a snob the past few years, especially when it comes to games designed for children. My son has been making up games since he was two years old, and playing roleplaying and board games since he was three. He isn't special in this regard, either: play is something for which children seem to need _no_ instruction. More importantly,

It seems like the board game industry has decided that children should only play games "designed" for their age group (what science is employed here I can only guess). Many boast that they help teach children important lessons through play, including cooperation, critical thinking, patience, etc. Unfortunately my experience with most popular board games has been rather poor, particularly in terms of _fun_. Although these sorts of games tend to teach the basics pretty well (taking turns, numbers mean things, etc) they rarely foster a fun play experience.

At the core of these kinds of games is a failure to consider one thing that children (and adults) really care about: **Agency**. What makes a game _interesting_ (and fun) is the level of decision-making agency a player has each turn, and most children's games seem to have forgotten this.

In many games the results of play are pre-determined: in _Candyland_, the game session has already been written once the cards are shuffled. In _Count Your Chickens_, a spinner is used to determine the next move, and the next, and so on. There is no input from the players; a robot arm could shuffle the deck or flick the spinner and the results would unfold exactly the same way. There is no strategy, logic or decisions on the part of the player.

This does not mean that these games have no value; _Candyland_ is a great structure for learning the basics: turns, pieces, cards, etc. It has a [fine history](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2019/07/how-polio-inspired-the-creation-of-candy-land/594424/) as well. But the basic structure has been repeated in other games, sometimes with simple changes (dice for cards, apples for candy). I feel like children eventually tire of these sorts of games, moving towards mixed systems like _Sorry!_, and (hopefully) later on towards play experiences built around skill, player choice and imagination.

I am fortunate that my child quickly moved on from the agency-free games and into competitive and cooperative games of skill and chance. If you're curious, here are a few that we like:

- _Amazing Tales_
- _Hoot Owl Hoot_
- _Sorry!_
- _Race to the Treasure_
- _Rivers, Roads, Rails_
- _Outfoxed!_
- _Parcheesi__

### The Dungeon Game
My son and I have been wrote this game together. It's pretty simple, uses minis/game pieces, wooden blocks, and can be played with or without a GM. Adventurers explore a dungeon or cool location, searching for treasure and fighting monsters.

#### Setup
Build a dungeon. You can use any blocks you like! [Ben Milton](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQ-ccPthhDY) recently recommended [these](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00XV13FQG), but any will do. Jenga blocks make good walls.

Populate the dungeon with monsters. We've used pieces from other board games for the monsters, treasure, and traps (if you like). If you have minis, now is your chance to use them!

_Most importantly_ get some real **treasure**. Licorice, fruit, chocolate coins, whatever. Put it all in a cup or bowl and put it to one side, with instructions that it not be touched until the adventure is concluded.

Finally, come up with a reason for the Adventurers to explore the dungeon. Here are a few I've used:
- To find treasure (gold, items & scrolls)
- To rescue a kidnapped friend
- To explore a new place

#### Basic Rules
- Adventurers & Monsters have Health Points (HP) and bonuses. No other stats.
- On their turn, an Adventurer can move _and_ take an action/attack.
- If an adventurer takes a risky action, they roll a d6. On a 5-6 they are successful.
- Add +1 to the roll if an Adventurer has an item or skill that can help them succeed. Otherwise, they automatically succeed.

#### Spells & Magic
- Spellbooks contain a short list of spells. Reading a spellbook takes a single action.
- Spells can be cast once per adventure and do not require a roll to succeed.
- Common spells: Fireball, Fly, Fog Cloud, Freeze, Heal, Shapeshift, Sleep.  
- Scrolls are single-use spells not typically found in spellbooks.  

#### Combat
- Initiative: at the start of combat both sides roll a d6, the higher goes first.
- Each "side" takes turns. Adventurers and monsters go in whatever order they wish.
- Attackers roll a d6; on a 5-6 they are successful. Some weapons or abilities provide a single +1 bonus to the attack.

#### Adventurers
- Fighter: 6 HP, Sword (makes two separate attacks)
- Ranger: 5 HP, +1 Bow (ranged attacks), pet (owl, wolf, etc)
- Thief: 4 HP, Throwing Daggers, lockpicks, quick (+1 to initiative roll)
- Magic-User: 3 HP, Staff, Spellbook (4 spells)

#### Monsters
- Goblin: 2 HP, Sword, group (initiative bonus in groups of 3 or more)
- Lizardkin: 3 HP, Sword & Shield, roar (calls other Lizardkin)
- Ogre: 6 HP, Club (attack hit 2 targets)
- Assassin: 4 HP, Poison Bow (+1 to ranged attacks)
- Sorcerer: 3 HP, Spellbook (2 spells)
- Shadow Monster: 1 HP, mimics an Adventurer and their abilities/weapons
