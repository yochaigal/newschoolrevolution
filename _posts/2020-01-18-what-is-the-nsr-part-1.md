On December 21nd, [Shane Ivey](https://mobile.twitter.com/Pandatheist) published a short entry on his blog [Bone Box Chant](https://boneboxchant.wordpress.com) called ["New School Revolution."](https://boneboxchant.wordpress.com/2019/12/21/nsr/) What I found so inspiring about this post was how accurately he'd been able to describe the exact play style I preferred, without the classic snobbishness you might expect from such a thought-provoking piece. In this series of posts, I hope to expand a bit upon Shane's definitions of this unique style of play. I've reproduced the original description here:

<p></p>
### NSR games have:
* A GM
* A Weird Setting
* A Living World
<p></p>
### are:
* Rules lite
* Deadly
<p></p>
### and focus on:
* Emergent Narrative
* External Interaction
* Exploration
<p></p>

And that's basically it! Inclusive. No purity tests, no rules requirements, no us vs them, just a brief list of stuff to help find games that match your taste. Think of this(with maybe the exception of the GM requirement) as a series of Venn Diagrams. The more you hit the more people will agree with your categorization.

So what’s the point of this? Games like Mothership, World of Dungeons, Troika, and Into the Odd have almost nothing in common if you just look at the mechanics. But drop someone who enjoys any one of those into a game of the other and they’ll probably have a good time. The games all share a perspective. The term NSR is useful in that it describes a style of play. “If I like game X I will probably like game Y.” or “I don’t love game X as written but I can run it in an NSR style."

I have no interest in introducing yet another term for internecine warfare. But I see a descriptive gap for this style of play. OSR is heavily tied to old school D&D. Artpunk hasn’t really caught on. Sword Dream is mostly an itch.io phenomena. It feels like we need something else. Please use the term NSR if you find it useful. I certainly do.

## What this all means (part 1).
Let's break this down a bit, starting with the shared properties of these so-called NSR games. I think we all already know what having _A GM_ means, so I'll move right along to _A Weird Setting_. To me, _Weird_ in the context of RPGs can mean a couple of things:
* A subversion of tropes, especially from the Fantasy and Science Fiction genres.
* The players may sometimes feel _unsettled_ by their interactions with the world.  
* Mystery and the unknown are major factors in play.

Not to be confused with [_Gonzo_](https://dungeonspossums.blogspot.com/2019/02/what-does-gonzo-mean-to-you.html) settings, the _Weird_ features characters trying to make sense of an increasingly confusing, abnormal, or terrifying world. Players are not expected to _conquer_ the world, but instead to try and overcome its inherit strangeness. As [The Luminescent Lich
](http://luminescentlich.blogspot.com/2017/06/the-gonzo-vs-weird.html) writes, it is through _the thrill of discovery and the atmosphere of the fantastic_ that the players experience _The Weird_ in play. Over the past few years, there have been quiet a few game systems & settings released with this sort of play experience in mind. One in particular stands out:
<br>

### Troika! Numinous Edition
There is likely no better example of a _Weird Setting_ than [Troika!](https://www.troikarpg.com/), from [Daniel Sell](https://twitter.com/ignus) & the Melsonian Arts Council. In his [review](https://cannibalhalflinggaming.com/2019/02/27/troika-review/) of Troika!, [Aaron Marks](https://twitter.com/levelonewonk) of [Cannibal Halfing Gaming](https://cannibalhalflinggaming.com/) writes:

_"Imagine, if you will, that Douglas Adams and Terry Pratchett have returned from the dead. They both pile into a Ford Cortina and take a long drive across the American Southwest, pondering the nature of the fantasy genre. Once they arrive in California, they legally acquire several ounces of the finest cannabis sativa and hotbox the Cortina. Then they write an RPG."_

The publisher's website describes Troika!'s as follows (less relevant items left out):
* A science-fantasy universe in the spirit of works such as Dying Earth, Viriconium, and Book of the New Sun.
* No huge essays explaining the setting or lore! Everything you need to know is tucked away inside the items, spell, enemies and backgrounds.
* The freedom to allow and positively encourage every group of players to interact with the setting differently; each game group will be unique.
* 36 unique player character backgrounds from Ardent Giant of Corda to Zoanthrope​.

There's a lot to unpack here; as such I'm only going to focus on what I perceive as the core of what makes this game _Weird_: the player character backgrounds. From the game rules:

"_Roll randomly to determine your starting Background. Notice that they only touch the edge of specificity: it is up to you to tailor them to the worlds you play in. Rework them or remove them entirely and replace them with your own unique vision of the spheres. Boldy lay claim to the games you play, create content recklessly, and always write in pen._"

These backgrounds really do provide a framework for truly unique and _weird_ play. Want an example? This [character generator](https://technicalgrimoire.com/troikagenerator) by [David Schirduan](https://twitter.com/davidschirduan) has you covered:

The person playing this character would start with something called the _Bridle of Aeons_? What does that do? What does it mean for the world we're building? The character backgrounds, the writing and the absolutely gorgeous art really helps the GM (and the players) lean-in to the _Weird_. I strongly recommend you check out this [review](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvhtyihMSjI) of the system by [Questing Beast](http://questingblog.com/). The game's art is _perfect_ for the setting it encourages.
