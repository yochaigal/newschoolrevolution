Welcome to Part 2 of my [What Is The NSR](https://newschoolrevolution.com/posts-by-tags.html#nsr) series of posts. Today, I'd like to talk about the role of the GM in NSR games. This is sure to be a very subjective take, of course, but as the NSR label is still in a bit of flux, I think we're all allowed a little bit of license.

As you may recall, the [strict definition](https://boneboxchant.wordpress.com/2019/12/21/nsr/) of **New School** games is that they must have _a_ GM (or Referee, or Judge, or Conductor, etc). For contrast, this means that games which have multiple GMs, or rotating GMs, or are GMless (like my personal favorite, _Microscope_) are not by definition NSR games.

***Sidebar***: this is _not_ to say that NSR games cannot bring players into the worldbuilding process! I have personally experienced great pleasure in _asking questions_ and _using the answers_, as Dungeon World and other PbtA games [suggest](https://forums.gauntlet-rpg.com/t/dungeon-starters-advice/2504). The most important thing here I think is to ensure that the _players are not authors of their character's adversity, as well as its solution_, as [Paul Czege](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Czege) would say. I could elaborate on this quite a bit, actually; fodder for a future post, perhaps.

In my opinion, the role of the GM in NSR games is solidly rooted in traditional [OSR principles](https://lithyscaphe.blogspot.com/p/principia-apocrypha.html), with very little deviation. As such, I'm not going to reiterate was has already been said far better than I ever could. Instead I will focus solely on how the role of the GM interacts with the other pillars of NSR play.

### The GM is a Game Designer
Tying in directly with another NSR definition (**NSR games are rules-lite**), the GM must be able to adjudicate an outcome, (within the fiction or as a result of the dice), without clear directions from the game or setting material. Like the OSR, openness is a major part of the NSR play experience, and is required for there to be **an emergent narrative**, another NSR focus.

In general, this means that there will never be a rule for every scenario. Instead, the GM will often adjudicate situations based on a _conversation_ with the players, accounting for any previous outcomes within the established fiction and gameplay experience, then finally slotting in their decision within the game's existing rule structure.

Finally, these new _rules_ serve to transform the game, by necessity. One table's idea of a game might appear wholly different from another; RAW (rules as written) only matter if they serve to deliver the play experience your group desires. Rule systems are not holy texts, but rather structures for a shared play experience.

### The GM is Principled
As this series of posts should (hopefully) demonstrate, NSR games are guided by a set of principles. The reason an NSR GM should facilitate **Deadly** situations is not to kill the characters, but rather to encourage creative, _informed decisions_ about risk.

Similarly, in order to create an **Emergent Narrative**, the players must feel that they are experiencing a **Living World**, something they actually want to **Explore**. This will all be explored in great detail in the relevant future posts, but in general, that means:

* #### Prepare situations, not plots
* #### Inform players of the risks
* #### Let the story be an _effect_ of play
* #### Uphold Logic and consistency
* #### Reward clever solutions
* #### Challenge them

### The GM is an Interpreter


### The GM is a Player
