# Dungeon World vs OSR

Over the past month or so I've been fielding a number of questions about GMing Dungeon World and how that differs from most OSR games. The answer is actually fairly simple, as the explicit principles and rules of Dungeon World make things pretty clear. Although the "OSR" as a movement doesn't have explicit principles, there have been a few attempts over the years so that's what I'll compare them to. I'm not going to belabor over _all_ of the differences, either - I think some are quite compatible, in fact. Let's begin.

## OSR Principles from according to the [Principia Apocrypha](https://lithyscaphe.blogspot.com/p/principia-apocrypha.html).

The "Cardinal" Principle: **Your Table is Yours**

**Be an Impartial Arbiter**
- Rulings Over Rules
- Divest Yourself of Their Fate
- Leave Preparation Flexible
- Build Responsive Situations
- Embrace Chaos...
- ...But Uphold Logic
- Let Them Off the Rails

**Get Them Thinking**
- XP for Discovery and Adversity
- Player Ingenuity Over Character Ability
- Cleverness Rewarded, Not Thwarted
- Ask Them How They Do It
- Let Them Manipulate The World
- Good Items Are Unique Tools
- Don’t Mind The Fourth Wall

**Build Rocks & Hard Places**
- Offer Tough Choices
- Build Challenges With Multiple Answers...
- ...And Challenges With No Answer
- Subvert Their Expectations

** Dice With Death**
- Deadly But Avoidable Combat
- Keep Up The Pressure
- Let The Dice Kill Them...
- ...But Telegraph Lethality

**Be Their World**
- Reveal The Situation
- Give Them Layers To Peel
- Don’t Bury The Lead
- NPCs Aren't Scripts
- Keep The World Alive

## Dungeon World

**Agenda**
- Make the world fantastic
- Fill the characters' lives with adventure
- Play to find out what happens

**The Principles**
- Draw maps, leave blanks
- Address the characters, not the players
- Embrace the fantastic
- Make a move that follows
- Never speak the name of your move
- Give every monster life
- Name every person
- Ask questions and use the answers
- Be a fan of the characters
- Think Dangerous
- Begin and end with the fiction
- Think offscreen, too

Let's start from the top.

## Rulings Over Rules
This is a tricky one. PbtA is very much designed to "collapse" gracefully. That's great for making "rulings" at the table. However, _many_ of the rules are are necessary to enforce the genre model, which in play leads to a culture of _not_ making rules. The Moves and Triggers are the scaffold of play, and the GM is rarely encouraged to forget them. New moves can be created, but those are also contained within the same framework.

## Divest Yourself of Their Fate
This is a doozy. In Dungeon World, you are instructed to "Be a fan of the characters" and "Address the characters, not the players", both of which yield a gameplay experience that reinforces a core PbtA trope: the character's story is the most important thing. The Dungeon World rules themselves reinforce this again; moves like "Last Breath" make it pretty hard to kill a PC (or TPK for that matter). And 24 HP for a Fighter at Level 1 is pretty crazy!

## Player Ingenuity Over Character Ability
This is an example where OSR games directly contradict basic PbtA conventions, particularly in Dungeon World. In most OSR games, Wisdom is a stat, and perception checks still exist. Recent bleeding-edge OSR games (like Into The Odd) totally eschew this concept, which I'm a huge fan of! However, even in games that use Wisdom as a perception mechanic, the information fed to the players about what their characters can perceive is not based on dice rolls. OSR games tend to provide clues to puzzles, traps and mysterious in a way that encourages player engagement, not a reliance on the PC's perception stats. The same goes for knowledge/lore rolls. OSR games prefer Luck? Die of Fate rolls and similar methods for determining what a PC "knows."

In Dungeon World, **Discern Realities** depends entirely on the PC's Wisdom stat (much like in some OSR games). However, the success of the roll determines the FACTS THE PLAYER WILL LEARN.  
Things like:
- What happened here recently?
- What is about to happen?
- What should I be on the lookout for?
- What here is useful or valuable to me?
- Who’s really in control here?
- What here is not what it appears to be?

And look at **Spout Lore**:  
- On a 10+, the GM will tell you something interesting and useful about the subject relevant to your situation.
- On a 7–9, the GM will only tell you something interesting—it’s on you to make it useful. The GM might ask you “How do you know this?” Tell them the truth, now.

There is no player skill over character skill happening, there.

I like collaborative worldbuilding, of course. But some PbtA games (not Dungeon World, at least beyond Session Zero) have you directly contribute to the worldbuilding. To me that violates the Czege Principle, which I do happen to agree with for these types of games.

The rules and principles _make killing players hard_.
And that means violence - or rather, the avoidance of violence - is not a good way to encourage critical thinking.
OSR games use _violence_ to force creative problem solving. They also use the rules-lite (e.g. no Moves are Rules) to assist with out of the box thinking.


General summary:
In my opinion, if you value critical thinking, problem solving, exploration etc in a game, PbtA will have a hard time delivering.
How does a player think critically, when your PC is doing it for you? How satisfying is exploration, when you are simply "told" the discovery through dice rolls?
