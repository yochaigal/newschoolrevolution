You've likely already heard about the [Bundle for Racial Justice and Equality](https://itch.io/b/520/bundle-for-racial-justice-and-equality) hosted by Itch.io in the wake of mass protests against police brutality and institutional racism. I highly recommend it - there are a whole bunch terrific indie RPGs and indie video games included, and the list keeps growing (at present there are 1637+ items from nearly 1000 creators). [Here](https://randombundlegame.com/) is a terrific front-end someone made for the bundle; I found it very helpful.

Below is an ongoing list of interesting tabletop RPG products included in the bundle that usually cost money, and are of at least a passing interest to me; some I own already but think you should know about it, too. I'll try and keep it up to date as this goes on (last update: June 12th, 2020).
