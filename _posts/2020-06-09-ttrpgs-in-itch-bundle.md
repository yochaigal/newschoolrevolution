You've likely already heard about the [Bundle for Racial Justice and Equality](https://itch.io/b/520/bundle-for-racial-justice-and-equality) hosted by Itch.io in the wake of mass protests against police brutality and institutional racism. I highly recommend it - there are a whole bunch terrific indie RPGs and indie video games included, and the list keeps growing (at present there are 1,000 items from nearly 800 creators). [Here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1cbOqO6rq0YYWPKmci8Pgv4YGWcl4NQUX9EAj221Ze30/edit?usp=sharing) is an up-to-date listing of the games; I found it very helpful.

Below is an ongoing list of interesting tabletop RPG products included in the bundle that usually cost money, and are of at least a passing interest to me. I'll try and keep it up to date as this goes on.
