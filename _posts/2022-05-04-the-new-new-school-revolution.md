# The New New School Revolution

This is not one of those "look at how we've grown!" posts, I swear. Instead this is one of those "how did we get here?" kinds of posts, which I swear is totally different! To do that, I'll talk a bit about the definition of the term NSR, as well as some of its associated history and impact.

## A Definition No One Will Argue With
As of Wednesday, May 4th 2022 you can read the "complete" definition of all the elements of an NSR-style game [here](https://boneboxchant.wordpress.com/2022/05/04/revisiting-the-nsr/) on **Pandatheist's** blog. This is wonderful on the one hand, as now I can point to this post and say, "here's a definition for design purposes! Now go make stuff."

But I know that that won't be good enough, because the **NSR** is not simply a play style or game design philosophy. It is so much more than that. And I plan on explaining exactly what I mean... right now. Here it is, folks: I'm going to define what the word NSR means to _me_ so that Google & future historians can reference yet another blog in their endless pursuit to record and destroy the world's information!

_The NSR means whatever the fuck you want it to mean_.

I'm not being pithy! I mean it. Go on, take it! If it fits what you're doing, use it. Welcome to the community. Because to me, the _real_ definition of NSR is _not_ beholden to the definition linked above (though I do appreciate and agree with it as a framework for play). To me and many, many others the NSR is a _community_, full stop. I talk to my friends on the NSR Discord more often than most of my IRL friends, both publicly and in DMs. I've met quite a few in the flesh as well. I rely on their creativity, sensitivity and humor to get through the day (especially these past few years). The community we've built is much bigger than a play style or brand. Instead it is a network of people united by _beliefs_ and _principles_.

Here are a few examples of what _regular_ NSR Discord members have said about the term NSR, picked semi-randomly:

It feels like the NSR "community" is known for being open, creative, supportive... Pretty nice, right? There are 64 game tagged "NSR" on [Itch.io Physical Games](https://itch.io/physical-games/tag-nsr), and about 8 in their "Games" section. I reckon quite a few of us have likely forgotten to include it as a tag as well (ahem).

So... How did we get here? Where are we going? Who is this "we" I'm talking about, anyhow?

## Who Knows How Words Are Formed?

It's been over two years since the [first post](/2020/01/19/what-is-the-nsr-part-1) of this blog, and the "public" opening of the [NSR Discord](https://cairnrpg.com/discord-server/). We've also launched a [Discourse](https://discourse.rpgcauldron.com/) forum that I'm quite proud of, despite failing to post there as often as I'd like.

Most folks probably already know the term "NSR" owes its origin to a [Bone Box Chant](https://boneboxchant.wordpress.com/) post by [**Pandatheist**](https://twitter.com/Pandatheist), though on her blog she points to a slightly [earlier conversation](https://twitter.com/BrianBloodaxe/status/1191422690952990724) between **[Necropraxis](https://twitter.com/necropraxis)** and **[Brian Ashford](https://twitter.com/BrianBloodaxe)**:

You can see **Pandatheist** take up the mantel [here](https://twitter.com/Pandatheist/status/1191806991863296000):

But that is not the _whole_ story. Because even at our community's earliest stages, something sinister loomed.

## Fear is the Community Killer
Behind those first few tremblings, something else was [stirring](https://twitter.com/vagrant_dwarf/status/1191842212218314753):

I get where this person is coming from. Their fear is all too real, a specter that [haunts](https://lotbieth.blogspot.com/2022/03/protecting-our-spaces-response-to-raggi.html) this hobby, as well as so many [other](https://lotbieth.blogspot.com/2021/04/productive-scab-picking-on-oppressive.html) others as well. And it raises a fine question, one I've been poring over for some time:

_What do we do when something we love becomes overwhelmed by nazis, bigots, fascists, transphobes, and the like? How do we combat their influence, their power? And how well have we done so far?_
