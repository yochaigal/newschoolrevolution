# The New New School Revolution

This is not one of those "look at how we've grown!" posts, I swear. Instead this is one of those "what does it all mean?" kinds of posts, and to do that I should probably cover a bit of the history of the NSR movement (or community, or playstyle... you get it).

It's been over two years since the [first post](/2020/01/19/what-is-the-nsr-part-1) of this blog, and the "public" opening of the [NSR Discord](https://cairnrpg.com/discord-server/). We've also launched a [Discourse](https://discourse.rpgcauldron.com/) forum that I'm quite proud of, despite failing to post often enough. As most folks probably already know the term "NSR" owes its origin to a [Bone Box Chant](https://boneboxchant.wordpress.com/) post by [**Pandatheist**](https://twitter.com/Pandatheist), though on her blog she points to a slightly [earlier conversation](https://twitter.com/BrianBloodaxe/status/1191422690952990724) between **Necropraxis** and **Brian Ashford**:

You can see **Pandatheist** take up the mantel [here](https://twitter.com/Pandatheist/status/1191806991863296000):

This is all very interesting, certainly. But behind that initial conversation, something else lurked. The first tremblings of a new definition, certainly. But more than that - there was the slightest element of [fear](https://twitter.com/vagrant_dwarf/status/1191842212218314753):

I understand this fear. It haunts this hobby (and so many other places as well). What do we do when something we love becomes overwhelmed by nazis, bigots, fascists, transphobes, and the like? How do we combat their influence and power, and how well have we done as a community?

First, lets start with definitions (again)
