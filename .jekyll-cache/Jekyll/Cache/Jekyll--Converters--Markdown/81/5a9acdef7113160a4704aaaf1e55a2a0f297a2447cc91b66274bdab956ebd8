I"²<p>The mods of the Into The Odd Discord (which includes me) are throwing a month-long â€œEclectic Bastion Jamâ€ over at <a href="https://itch.io/jam/eclectic-bastion-jam">Itch.io</a>. Weâ€™re encouraging folks to create a hack, adventure, dungeon, failed career, oddity, etc for Chris McDowallâ€™s excellent Into The Odd: Electric Bastionland. There is no prize, nor is there any judging/ranking. Our initial goals were to increase the amount of content and hacks available for this incredible system (though the latter is well <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ipMsbNE5EH6-1_d58o_JfneF2XA4yWqfr5XxJInSzqI/edit#bookmark=id.a7zji32jrcr2">established</a> already).</p>

<p>It started Thursday night, but I was out of town so Iâ€™m a bit late to the party. So far weâ€™ve had 85 participants! Thatâ€™s exciting.</p>

<p>Please: join in! It doesnâ€™t matter if youâ€™ve never created anything Into The Odd or even RPG related before.</p>
