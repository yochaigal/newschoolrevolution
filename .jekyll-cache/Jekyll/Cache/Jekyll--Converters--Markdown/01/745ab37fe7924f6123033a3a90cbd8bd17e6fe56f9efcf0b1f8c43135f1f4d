I"?<p>Youâ€™ve likely already heard about the <a href="https://itch.io/b/520/bundle-for-racial-justice-and-equality">Bundle for Racial Justice and Equality</a> hosted by Itch.io in the wake of mass protests against police brutality and institutional racism. I highly recommend it - there are a whole bunch terrific indie RPGs and indie video games included, and the list keeps growing (at present there are 1637+ items from nearly 1000 creators). <a href="https://randombundlegame.com/">Here</a> is a terrific front-end someone made for the bundle; I found it very helpful.</p>
