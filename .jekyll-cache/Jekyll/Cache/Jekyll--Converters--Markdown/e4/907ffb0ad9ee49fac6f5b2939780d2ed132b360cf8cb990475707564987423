<h4 id="one-shot-world"><a href="https://yochaigal.itch.io/oneshotworld">One Shot World</a></h4>
<p>One Shot World is a hack of Dungeon World that removes most of the long-form mechanics and replaces them with simple rules designed to facilitate one-shots and short campaigns. There are also some useful tools in the GM Booklet (session starters, worldbuilding tips, etc) that would work for other systems, as well.<br />

<p>When I first discovered Dungeon World, I was overwhelmed by the incredible amount of 3rd-party resources, playbooks, hacks, etc that folks had built for the system. So I decided to chronicle my findings. Over the years, this document has become the go-to point of reference for many new GMs &amp; players alike.<br />

<p>Keys are goals, ties, beliefs, or vows a character has. They are meant to replace Alignment or Drives completely. Shamelessly stolen from better designers.

<p>An alternative spellcasting playbook to the Wizard, that doesnâ€™t require spell memorization, and uses CHA as a prime stat. Iâ€™m pretty proud of the move titles.

<p>When I started running Into The Odd, I again found a system with a veritable bouquet of excellent tools, hacks, tips &amp; resources, but no single place to keep all of the relevant links! And thus the Into The Odd Syllabus was born.<br />
<br /></p>
