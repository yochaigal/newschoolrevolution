<h3 id="one-shot-world"><a href="https://yochaigal.itch.io/oneshotworld">One Shot World</a></h3>
<p>One Shot World is a hack of Dungeon World that removes most of the long-form mechanics and replaces them with simple rules designed to facilitate one-shots and short campaigns. There are also some useful tools in the GM Booklet (session starters, worldbuilding tips, etc) that would work for other systems, as well.</p>

<p>When I first discovered Dungeon World, I was overwhelmed by the incredible amount of 3rd-party resources, playbooks, hacks, etc that folks had built for the system. So I decided to chronicle my findings. Over the years, this document has become the go-to point of reference for many new GMs &amp; players alike.</p>

<h3 id="keys-for-dungeon-world"><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1TMtedwe7X_CZ6K07rdJfGR904RgamtFJYOXLUaia87E/edit">Keys for Dungeon World</a></h3>
<p>Keys are goals, ties, beliefs, or vows a character has. They are meant to replace Alignment or Drives completely. Shamelessly stolen from better designers.</p>

<h3 id="the-sorcerer-playbook-dungeon-world"><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0BzeF5GXNEsnfdDhkZV9tZDNwQVk">The Sorcerer Playbook</a> (<a href="https://dungeon-world.com/">Dungeon World</a>)</h3>
<p>An alternative spellcasting playbook to the Wizard, that doesn’t require spell memorization, and uses CHA as a prime stat. I’m pretty proud of the move titles.</p>

<p>When I started running Into The Odd, I again found a system with a veritable bouquet of excellent tools, hacks, tips &amp; resources, but no single place to keep all of the relevant links! And thus the Into The Odd Syllabus was born.</p>
